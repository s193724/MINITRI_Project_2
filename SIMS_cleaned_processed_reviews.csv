It still costs hundreds of dollars to buy all the DLC for this game, and let me tell you that they've made everything into a DLC. Want a pet? DLC. Want to take your Sims out to a restaurant sometimes during the week like a normal person would do? DLC. Want to pretty much do anything with your Sims besides have them sit at home or wait for them to come back from working a job? DLC. It's after you play for a while and decide you want to start doing things, that you realize you actually can't do sh** until you buy some DLC. This game has been out for years and there still isn't a bundle with all the DLC. I'm not going to buy a single pack, EA, you damn buffoons. I would have been happy to spend up to like $100 total on this game, but now I will stick with the free version and not spend a dime on the stupidly overpriced DLC.

1222670,2021-07-01,"TLDR: DO NOT BUY BASE SIMS 4!! Buy it HEAVILY DISCOUNTED bundled with one of the major expansions (Seasons or Pets), and MOD THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF IT!!   Base Sims 4 is nearly unplayable due to the lack of content, repetitive and easily manipulative emotions system, and an overall feeling of restriction. Which is damaging in a game series that is designed around player freedom. There are also so many irritating qualities to it that make it seem like it wasn't fine tweaked enough. Why is every single Sim such a social butterfly that I cannot get them to stop talking to each other for five seconds? Why do they take so long to eat? Why are the lots so small and so empty? Why is nearly nothing from Sims 3, and heck, even Sims 2 brought over?? (Horses, Cars, pools, restaurants, grocery stores, fun recreational activities, ect.)  With that being said, there is some classic Sim Fun to be had with this game, if you are able to get it for a heavily discounted price and get it bundled with one of the major expansions (I would recommend either Pets or Seasons). I would also highly recommend downloading a plethora of Mods, because they fix a vast majority of the systems in base Sims 4 that make it more enjoyable. If Mods are not your thing, then I would think twice about purchasing this game. **This is one of the easiest games to Mod fyi**  Mod Recommendations (Like seriously, don't even play base Sims 4 before downloading these Mods)  Sims 4 Mod Manager by Raxdiam (Not necessary, but a very convenient and easy way to keep track of your mods. Very user friendly, will do 100% of the work for you)  Meaningful Stories by roBurky (A mod pack that effectively revamps the mood and emotions systems of Sims 4. This makes the systems feel waaay more fleshed out and realistic, and significantly less manipulatable)  Better Romance by simler90 (Adds more rules and checks into how Sims romance one another. In base Sims 4, you are basically always guaranteed to succeed in romance. There is quite literally no way to fail. This Mod expands heavily upon it, making it so that the traits Sims have will impact whether or not they will accept any advances.)  Wonderful Whims by TURBODRIVER (Goes great with Better Romance with no compatibility issues that I'm aware of. Adds in an Attractiveness system, first Impressions, Personality Archetypes, and even a Menstrual Cycle and Birth Control system. With this, you are more equipped to design your Sims overall sexuality and sexual lives. Hugely rewarding, and designed perfectly that it will seem like it is a natural part of the game.)  There is also a ♥♥♥♥ load of CC (Custom Content) out there like clothes, hair, buildings, Sims, ect. ""Mod The Sims"" is the best place to find all of this. Don't spend money on any of the Stuff Packs, because most of that stuff included in them you'll find for free made by someone online. Usually looks nicer too.",24.3,Recommended,444,tldr buy base sims buy heavily discount bundle one major dlc season pet mod base sims nearly unplayable due lack content repetitive easily manipulative emotion system overall feeling restriction damage game series design around player freedom also many irritate quality make seem like fine tweak enough every single sims social butterfly get stop talk five second take long eat lot small empty nearly nothing sims heck even sims brought horse car pool restaurant grocery store fun recreational activity ect say classic sims fun game able get heavily discount price get bundle one major dlc recommend either pet season also highly recommend download plethora mods fix vast majority system base sims make enjoyable mods thing think twice purchase game one easy game mod fyi mod recommendation like seriously even play base sims download mods sims mod manager raxdiam necessary convenient easy way keep track mods user friendly work meaningful story roburky mod dlc effectively revamp mood emotion system sims make system feel waaay fleshed realistic significantly less manipulatable good romance simler90 add rule check sims romance one another base sims basically always guarantee succeed romance quite literally way fail mod expand heavily upon make trait sims impact whether accept advance wonderful whim turbodriver go great good romance compatibility issue aware add attractiveness system first impression personality archetype even menstrual cycle birth control system equipped design sims overall sexuality sexual life hugely reward design perfectly seem like natural part game also load cc custom content like clothes hair building sims ect mod sims best place find spend money stuff dlc stuff include find free make someone online usually look nicer

1222670,2023-01-23,"Before this review, I feel like it's important to say that I have more than 23.7 hours in this game. A LOT more. I've got that much alone on PS4, and 500+ hours on my original origin account, which I can sadly no longer access to check the exact number. I got this game 9 years ago, full price retail, and have played it on and off since the age of 9. I've played this game to death over the years, and that's why it hurts me to leave a negative review. You can still have fun with it, and I will explain that, but it's flaws are just too plentiful for me to leave a positive review.  It would be easy to say that this game used to be great, but that... would be a blatant lie. The game was barren when it released. Key features from past games were missing, like toddlers and POOLS. How were we supposed to kill our sims now? Give them a long and happy life until a natural death? Hardly! Along with that, the map screens didn't even have colour; they were pure white, sterile places. Maybe it was supposed to be stylistic, but... I can't help but think about how much cheaper it must have been.  Slowly, over the years, we started to get more DLC packs of various tiers. It didn't start out too egregious, I wouldn't say. Sure, Luxury Party Stuff was lacklustre, but we had things like Outdoor Retreat to keep us going! Though, it was hard not to note how quickly EA had jumped to make DLC whilst the core game was missing such basic features. That isn't even to say how the community at large took the closed-world and lack of colour and pattern customisation. I'll tell you how they took it; badly. They took it badly.  With all this DLC, there was a problem.  IT. DIDN'T. STOP.  Now, it's normal for a Sims game to have a large amount of DLC. But this? It became staggering. As of this review, all of the DLC for this game will run you over $800.  OVER. EIGHT. HUNDRED. DOLLARS.  I'll let that sink in.  Have you ever wondered how this game is free? That's how. It's not like this DLC is truly optional. Some of it is, sure! But would you like your life simulator to have weather? A normal amount of clothes? More than THREE PLACES TO LIVE, ONE OF THEM BEING AN EMPTY FIELD? Then you'd best pony up! It's hard to fully express how empty this game feels without DLC. And EA knows it feels that empty, and that they can keep milking us for every last cent.  At this point, you may have noticed something, or you may have not. And that's the fact that I said I've been playing this game for nine years. And that means the game has been out for nine years now. Since 2014. This game is almost a decade old. This is an issue. A big issue. When this game first released, it prided itself on it's intelligent autonomous sims. They can multitask; like watching television AND eating at the same time! Wowzers! But with this much time having passed, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody confident to call these sims anything above 'serviceable, I guess'. Your sims will wash their plates in the bathroom! Your sims will grab water if you leave them alone for two seconds and drink until they experience bladder failure! Your sims will start a fight with their spouse, seemingly just for kicks! Your sims will stop moving until you reset them with a cheat code! Your sims will be left with an undeletable action in their queue until you, again, use a cheat code! You get the picture. This game is a mess, with problems that could be wiped clean in a theoretical Sims 5. So why don't they?  Because EA have created a live-service single-player game, and they'd be stupid to give it up.  This live-service model, piling DLC upon DLC onto the game? It's managed to cause even more issues than the game had to begin with. Each new download comes with new bugs unique in nature. Oops, there go your textures! Oops, your sims are now all autonomously screaming at each other! Oops, your Sims are BUILDING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN! These are the kinds of things you'll have to get used to, and this only gets worse each time they add DLC. There are problems in this game that have become support beams by this point; fix those bugs, and everything will fall apart. So they just... don't! The Sims 4 is fundamentally broken, and they won't throw the game out and start fresh, because the horse they're beating still isn't dead. Just bleeding and shambling.  This greed helped lead to the point we've reached today. Even with the uproar against My First Pet Stuff (A DLC for a DLC), it seemed enough people were content to buy such a tiny stuff pack because we got a whole new category for things just like it.  Kits. Dear lord, kits. These things aren't popular with the community, and it's clear to see why. Such meagre amounts of items might seem doable at $5 a pop, but they're adding up, and quick. Filled with lacklustre designs that only work well as a base for custom content, they're the peak of EA's lazy contributions to this game.  I mentioned custom content, so I suppose that's a horse out the stable now. Yeah, custom content is amazing. And that's because EA has no hand in it. Well, I should give them a little credit; the native mod support is an honestly nice touch! There's your first positive, EA.  Custom content is a general term for items created by the community. Clothes, furniture, accessories, you name it! With multiple dedicated sites to download it, and fan made tools that make creation easy, it's great! And by easy, I mean easy. I was making Pokemon shirts for my games at age 12. Just takes a little research. All these items come in two main styles; one more realistic (Alpha) and one to match the game's items (Maxis Match). Build up a good folder filled with gigabytes of fashion and get to work living your life in Create-A-Sim; don't forgot to buy a new SD card to fit it all in. You'll need it.  It's not just custom content that the community makes. There's also good old fashioned script mods. These have all sorts of functions; they can fix some in-game issues, add entirely new game mechanics, give you features that you always wanted (controllable pets comes to mind), and more. (More including the... infamous Wicked Whims and Extreme Violence mods. Ah, timeless classics). All these mods help breathe new life into the game and show how passionate this community can be, no matter how downtrodden by the source material.  These mods help to show how this game is actually fun at it's core. You might have read all this ragging and be baffled by my heel-turn, but it's true. Why else would I have put in all those hours? That core gameplay loop of letting your sims lead their lives is damn fun, and I can't help but enjoy it; even with everything EA is doing.  I think that others could enjoy it too if they started playing today. There is something here, at the heart of it. It's just coated in a decade of bloat and greed.  (This segment is a replacement for an old one that caused me issues, that I'm removing to keep this review safe. I think you can tell by the comments below and the tone of this review what that was, and you can take that as you wish.)  Anyway, EA can do one, and you should give Sims 4 a chance, if you like.

1222670,2022-06-10,"This is my favorite game that I can't recommend. I love this game, as my playtime will tell, and I will continue to pour more hours into this game. I'm not giving a negative review because of the game's ""fun factor."" It's very destressing, it's chill, its difficulty is all in the hands of the players. The modding scene is great, and the creative possibilities are infinite. On paper, the Sims 4 seems like the dream game. A perfect game that even people who have literally never touched a game before in their life can pick up and play. In reality, EA has erected a massive series of walls that you have to scale to reach that state, and this is the crux of the review. The ultimate problem is, and is the whole reason I'm giving this a negative review, is recommending people to buy this game because of the aforementioned walls. To say that they have become untenable is an understatement. They are nigh insurmountable at this point.  The first wall, and this is the point where most people stop at, is the pricing. It being free-to-play as of October 18th does not save this from being HORRIDLY expensive through DLC cost. The base Sims 4 with no expansions or packs, makes the game EXTREMELY limited in scope as to what you can do. Want to be a spellcaster? Want to attend university? Have cats or dogs? Have changing seasons in the weather? Form clubs? Get famous? Have a job? That's ALL locked behind DLC that is either the same price as the base game, or, get this, DOUBLE the price of the base game. All those things I listed? Those are SEPARATE DLCs! If you were to not get them on sale, it would run you a couple HUNDRED already! And this just getting started. On the store page, as I'm typing this right now, it lists 56 different DLC, and to buy them all in one fell swoop costs just short of a THOUSAND dollars. Nobody in their right mind should make that investment, and I can't be of the mind to tell someone to spend that much on a single game.  Now, to play Devil's Advocate for a moment, this is only as bad if you buy it when it isn't on sale, which the game goes on quite frequently. Deep sales, in fact! Up to 75% a lot of things, which bring down the price for everything by a couple hundred dollars. In fact, with the Summer Sale that's coming up as of the time of writing this review, this game will most likely get significant price slashes. However, to counter that point, the asking price is still SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. The prices become more manageable, but it is still a SIGNIFICANT investment. More of an investment than, frankly, I think this game deserves. And considering how Sims 3 with everything still costs such an outrageous amount, it would seem that those prices aren't going anywhere for the time being.  If a high asking price was all that kept people away, I suppose you could argue the point that not recommending a game you like because of pricing is silly. That if you put hundreds of hours in like I have, the price is ""worth it."" Perhaps that argument would have grounds and I would entertain it, if not for the fact that the game in of itself just fundamentally DOES NOT WORK with everything combined. These are the other walls, and this can become overwhelming for the inexperienced. Even if you buy everything and you jump in, the Sims 4 is a strange program that seemingly randomly decides to brick itself every so often, without you even really being the cause of it. There are so many bugs and glitches that have no fixes for it, merely ways to temporarily relieve of you of it, much like ibuprofen for a headache. And they aren't the silly, funny glitches seen in Skyrim.  For example, randomly, the game will begin to run under 30 frames after exiting build mode, and you solve it by merely pausing the game and unpausing it. Not a terrible bug but it's pretty much the epitome of the problems I have with this game: everything is just player made solutions rather than an official bug fix. It will happen again, and instead of just fixing it, EA just tells you what you can do to help yourself with it. You'll be doing this often, spending hours looking up some obscure error, through no fault of your own, because either Sims 4 randomly decides to brick your Resources.cfg after update and makes it impossible for you to play with CC of any kinds, or your anti virus somehow marks this entire game as potential ransomware, or the Sims 4 randomly just corrupt your save file and you're trying to figure out how to fix that. And that's just on the meta side of everything.  File headaches aside, the game itself just acts wonky as well, adding its own walls to scale. A cursory glance at the reviews for the DLCs illustrate the absolute nightmares that spawn with these additions, but I'll share some of the errors I've had on my end. I've had multiple instances where I tell a Sim to fulfill their hygiene need and their immediate first instinct is to...run out and clean a solar panel? In place of just taking a shower in one of the MULTIPLE showers that exist in that house? I tell them to fulfill their energy need, thinking they'll go to bed, and they'll either randomly decide to back float in the pool, or drink an incredibly irresponsible amount of coffee, like a third shift worker going off of only three hours of sleep. Fixed all of this by manually telling them what to do. I've also had moments where I couldn't wash laundry because the game bugged out my washer and dryer, where the prompts for washing never came up. Only the prompts for putting the dirty laundry in and taking the dirty laundry out. Fixed by selling the set and then buying another. I've also had my weather permanently glitch itself into never changing at all. Where it snows all through winter and all through spring, causing me to have to buy a weather changing device in game and use it. Sims will randomly drop whatever they are doing to do some unrelated task, such as stop cooking to randomly mold some hunk of clay sitting in some corner of the room. Sometimes, my Sims will also stand still with the ""chat with (sim)"" action in the queue, but then never actually chat with that person,, for whatever reason, causing them to bug ouit and need them to be reset. The list goes on and on, and I think you've gotten the point already.  Again, these are fixed by just manually selecting actions, using console commands, and removing the bugged items in question. I know what you're thinking. Why are you complaining about bugs that have an in game solution? The issue is, again, that this is just player solutions for problems that aren't being fixed. You're paying hundreds of dollars for this game and the DLC. You'd expect a level of polish to behind this, but there isn't. Players shouldn't have to actively fight against a game they bought, only to find a bunch of band-aid, player made solutions a because the FEATURES IN GAME THEY PAID HUNDREDS FOR DOESN'T WORK AND EA DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX THEM.  It's all the same hackneyed excuse of ""there being so much in this game"" and sounding like they are some small game dev studio. All of this frustration after the ludicrous pay wall is just simply unforgivable, and to recommend people this game knowing the hours worth of troubleshooting and fixing I've had to do is like to encourage self destructive tendencies. I made the investment, I bought the steam edition to make a review. I sunk a lot both in time and money, and have got to a point where I can say I enjoy this game, perhaps through Sunken Cost reasoning and Stockholm Syndrome. But it required me having to scale multiple walls and slaying multiple beasts to get there, and that's just simply not a journey for everyone. I cannot look at someone and genuinely tell them to make the same investments I have, nor do I think EA should benefit from having people do so.

And I did enjoy the game...at first. I started buying some DLC to have more stuff to do. I liked creating characters and watching them interact. But then I realized something. I spent a lot of time and money to play dollhouse. I listened to a community that had to wait several years to get basic features. Did you know this game first released without ghosts, pools, and toddlers? You know, staple parts of the series? Did you know it costs thousands of dollars to buy all the DLC to have all the content? Oh, and some of that content that used to be in the base game is now behind that paywall. And some of the DLC is basically buggy abandonware (like Dine Out and My Wedding Stories; don't get those packs unless you have mods to patch the bugs out). The newest expansions (which are $40) had a lot of bugs, glitches, and content issues (like in For Rent, you aren't being paid rent). Oh, and in a recent update you know get a pulsating ""shopping"" button on the in-game UI so you can buy more packs. That was the final straw. I have never seen a company act so disrespectful to its consumer base. This game is over a decade old, and it doesn't hold a candle to the older games.

Setting aside all of the EAisms about the game (obscenely expensive expansions to get basic game play features that should be in the base game, over inclusion of social media aspects, etc.) I was expecting a phenomenal experience. Instead, they seem to have limited the ability to travel, removing the semi-open world of TS3 and instead reverting back to a very old school system of traveling to what basically amounts to a few city blocks, which was the most disappointing feature. You can no longer have your sims travel to work in a real environment, instead they do the ole disappearing act and reappear after 8 hours. No more travelling to a grocery store, all supplies are magically bought and created out of thin air. I felt like I was playing TS1 or 2 again, and everything feels very stripped down and bare-bones, very much like a mobile game.

Reliance on DLC and microtransactions may restrict access to certain content and features for players unwilling or unable to make additional purchases.  - The absence of certain features, such as curved walls or split-level structures, may limit the game's creative potential for some players.  - Monetisation strategies and content-locking practices have raised concerns about the game's accessibility and value for money.  The game retains the core gameplay mechanics of the series, allowing players to create and customise virtual characters, build and furnish homes, and guide their Sims through various life stages and experiences.  Another significant addition is the Emotions system, which adds depth and complexity to the Sims' behaviour and interactions. Sims can now experience a wide range of emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and embarrassment, which are influenced by their environment, social interactions, and personal traits.  A central aspect of the sim's franchise experience is the building mechanics, which allow players to design, construct, and customise their Sims' homes and community lots.  One of the most notable improvements is introducing the room-based building system. This system allows players to create and manipulate individual rooms as modular units, making rearranging and modifying structures easier without requiring extensive reconstruction. This feature streamlines the building process and encourages experimentation. Thus, players can quickly test different layouts and configurations with minimal effort.  Another significant enhancement is the addition of the Build Mode catalogue, which offers a vast array of objects, materials, and decorative items for players to choose from. The catalogue is organised into intuitive categories and features a search function, making it easier for players to find and select the necessary items. This extensive selection of building and furnishing options enables players to create highly detailed and personalised environments that reflect their Sims' personalities, lifestyles, and aspirations.  Moreover, the game's vibrant modding community further enriches the building mechanics, which has produced a wealth of custom content, ranging from unique architectural elements to entire pre-built lots. This user-generated content expands the game's creative possibilities. It allows players to incorporate diverse styles and designs into their creations.  However, the building mechanics in ""The Sims 4"" have limitations. Some players have expressed frustration with the lack of certain features, such as the ability to create curved walls or split-level structures, which were available in previous iterations of the series. Additionally, the game's reliance on DLC and microtransactions mean that access to certain building materials and objects may be restricted for players who do not wish to make additional purchases.  In previous iterations of the series, certain features and content were included in the base game or expansion packs, providing players with a more comprehensive experience without additional purchases. However, ""The Sims 4"" has adopted a more aggressive monetisation strategy, with numerous expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs that collectively add to a significant financial investment for players wishing to access the full range of content. This has led to concerns about the game's reliance on downloadable content (DLC) and microtransactions, which can be seen as a barrier to entry for players with limited financial resources.  This form of microtransactions has been criticised for several reasons. Firstly, it can be seen as a form of artificial content scarcity. Once part of the core experience, features and content are now gated behind additional purchases. This can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction among players, who may feel that they are being unfairly charged for content that should have been included in the base game.  Secondly, this monetisation strategy raises concerns about the potential normalisation of microtransactions in the gaming industry, as it may encourage other developers and publishers to adopt similar practices. This could shift towards a more fragmented and costly gaming landscape, where players are increasingly expected to pay for additional content to enjoy a complete and fulfilling experience.  It is important to critically evaluate these monetisation strategies and consider their implications for the gaming industry and player experience. While developers and publishers have a legitimate need to generate revenue to sustain their operations and continue producing high-quality games, it is essential to balance financial viability and provide a fair, accessible, and enjoyable experience for players. By supporting more ethical and consumer-friendly monetisation practices, players can help to shape a more sustainable and equitable gaming landscape for all.  ""The Sims 4"" offers a unique and engaging virtual life simulation experience, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessors and introducing new features that enhance the player's ability to create and control virtual lives. The game's strengths lie in its emphasis on creativity, self-expression, and storytelling and its efforts to improve accessibility and inclusivity.

1222670,2022-03-10,"The Sims 4 is an expensive habit to keep if you are a person, like myself, who feels as if they absolutely must have every available DLC for a game which they enjoy. Without sales or bundling, as of writing this, the entirety of The Sims 4 will cost you a whopping $964.47. I can't say I am surprised, as this is an EA game, but that does not excuse the disgrace that price tag is.  On the other side of that spectrum, people who do not want to purchase any additional content, will more than likely be left dissatisfied with the base game. If you have played any of The Sims 4 predecessors, you will immediately notice that there are aspects ""missing"" from the base game experience that have either not been developed or have been withheld for the purpose of selling expansions/gamepacks/kits.  The more recently released packs have been borderline not play tested before release. If you check the credits for these packs you will notice a stark difference in the number of people developing these and the division of their roles compared to earlier packs. In the end, after a few patches, we do end up with something playable, but many bugs never get fixed.  I do believe it is possible to be satisfied with the game through two routes. Either A. The Sims 4 is your introduction to the franchise so you are unable to compare this title to its predecessors. or B. You curate a healthy mix of additional content alongside CC and mods.  Overall, I would give this game a 7/10 rating, only because of the healthy cc and mod community backing it.  Without any additional content, base game only, my rating drops to a 5/10- absolutely mediocre.  IN SUMMARY: too expensive for a complete experience, predecessors were better for gameplay (TS4 build/buy and character creation is superior imo), incredibly healthy modding community.",2849.9,Recommended,224,sims expensive habit keep person like feel absolutely must every available dlc game enjoy without sale bundle write entirety sims cost whop say surprise ea game excuse disgrace price tag side spectrum people want purchase additional content likely leave dissatisfied base game play sims predecessor immediately notice aspect miss base game experience either develop withhold purpose sell dlc gamepacks kit recently release dlc borderline play test release check credit dlc notice stark difference number people develop division role compare earlier dlc end patch end something playable many bug never get fix believe possible satisfy game two route either sims introduction franchise unable compare title predecessor curate healthy mix additional content alongside cc mods overall give game rating healthy cc mod community back without additional content base game rating drop absolutely mediocre summary expensive complete experience predecessor good gameplay ts4 buildmode buy character creation superior imo incredibly healthy mod community

1222670,2021-10-30,"I have a long history with the Sims franchise. I started playing The Sims 2 when I was a child because of my mother (and, back in the day, even my grandmother played it). I remember The Sims 3 coming out. I've loved these games ever since I can remember, and they have a very special place in my heart.  Buying this game on Steam was kinda useless, seeing as I already owned it since its release in 2014 on Origin (frankly, I just wanted to see those hours pile up on Steam whenever I get into the cycle of Remember Game Exists > Play Game Obsessively For A Short Period > Forget Game Exists, and I felt a little guilty about my, uhm, less-than-legitimate maritime exploration, to put it in a cute little ~metaphor~, of all of the DLC content over the years).  Now, would I recommend The Sims 4? Honestly, it depends. There are many different kinds of Simmers, and I don't think this is the most adequate for every single one of them.  Lore-wise? Girl, put on an eyepatch and go explore the Sims 2. If you're expecting fleshed out, non-half-assed stories, this will disappoint. (And it has. Why did they do the Caliente sisters this dirty? Why? I just wanna know...)  Building-wise? 100% MADE FOR YOU, BUY IT. I have never considered myself a builder, ever, but this game... Oh, man, it really boosts my self-esteem, not gonna lie. Whenever I make house I'm really proud of, I showcase it to every one. It's great! I think everyone can agree that this game has the best Build-and-Buy Mode that the Sims franchise has ever seen.  CAS-wise? Hmmmm, this one is tricky. Creating Sims is so fun, it's true, but without Custom Content? It's a no-go for me, thank you very much. I've recently discovered that a lot of people find the Sims 3 sims ugly, and that was honestly a HUGE surprise to me, because although the sims in The Sims 4 are much more aesthetically pleasing than in any of the other games WITH CUSTOM CONTENT INCLUDED, if I have to create vanilla sims? Nope. They're just kinda weird-looking, in my opinion, and I'd much rather play The Sims 3 if I'm not gonna include custom content.  Now, one thing that should go without saying is that EA IS VERY GREEDY. This isn't news to anyone, I know, but I'm just saying this to emphasize that if you're not planning on buying any DLC for this game you may as well just go on a lawless maritime exploration of it instead of purchasing it, because the base game itself is NOT IT. At all. It gets boring after a while.  My strategy going forward is probably going to be: play game > forget it exists > remember it exists > get the cheapest pack I can > play game with its new features. The DLC is very expensive, though, and that is something to remember. The Sims 3, for example, is worth playing with just the base game installed, in my opinion, so if you don't like to get absolutely scammed into giving EA your money, maybe try that one? Just don't get the Katy Perry stuff pack if you do decide to buy DLC after all. It's not worth it, bestie.  (So, yes, while I know I am scamming myself at this point by monetarily supporting this game, I decided to do it anyway! It was an impulse-buy. But I digress,)  Overall, The Sims 4 has gotten a lot better since it started. It's had a few hiccups along the road, and that's without counting the Star Wars pack, because I refuse to acknowledge that it wasn't a random fever dream I had. But it has gotten better, and I'd say it's worth playing if you pick a few DLC that you think you'll enjoy, and some Custom Content to your liking! I'd also recommend some mods like MC Command Center or other story progression mods just to make the game more realistic and fun. The Sims 4 community is active as hell on places like The Sims Resource or even Twitter and Tumblr, so make the most of it for your modding and/or objects and clothing needs. If you're not going to be taking part in any of that, though, for some reason... I'd refrain from playing this game at all. The Sims 4 is like sliced bread. You probably don't enjoy sliced bread by itself, or eat it very often, do you? It's plain, basic, and boring! The community provides some extra ingredients. If you won't be making a sandwich, you might as well not buy the plain-ass bread.",2738.1,Recommended,154,long history sims franchise start play sims child mother back day even grandmother play remember sims come love game ever since remember special place heart buying game steam kinda useless see already own since release origin frankly want see hour pile steam whenever get cycle remember game exist play game obsessively short period forget game exists felt little guilty uhm less legitimate maritime exploration put cute little metaphor dlc content year recommend sims honestly depend many different kind simmer think adequate every single one lore wise girl put eyepatch go explore sims expect flesh non half assed story disappoint caliente sister dirty wan na know buildmode wise make buy never consider builder ever game oh man really boost self esteem gon na lie whenever make house really proud showcase every one great think everyone agree game best buildmode buy mode sims franchise ever see cas wise hmmmm one tricky create sims fun true without custom content go thank much recently discover lot people find sims sims ugly honestly huge surprise although sims sims much aesthetically please game custom content include create vanilla sims nope kinda weird look opinion much rather play sims gon na include custom content one thing go without say ea greedy news anyone know say emphasize plan buy dlc game may well go lawless maritime exploration instead purchase base game get boring strategy go forward probably go play game forget exist remember exist get cheap dlc play game new feature dlc expensive though something remember sims example worth play base game instal opinion like get absolutely scammed give ea money maybe try one get katy perry stuff dlc decide buy dlc worth bestie yes know scamming point monetarily support game decide anyway impulse buy digress overall sims get lot good since start hiccup along road without count star war dlc refuse acknowledge random fever dream get well say worth play pick dlc think enjoy custom content like also recommend mods like mc command center story progression mods make game realistic fun sims community active hell place like sims resource even twitter tumblr make mod object clothing need go take part though reason refrain play game sims like slice bread probably enjoy slice bread eat often plain basic bore community provide extra ingredient make sandwich might well buy plain as bread

1222670,2020-07-02,"I broke down during the summer sale and bought the base game and several of the extras. I've been playing The Sims since its first version. When S4 came out I thought it might just be a money pit and stuck with S3, despite the many bugs 3 had. S3 had an awful lot of content.  I'm giving The Sims 4 a recommend, but barely. The first impression of it hasn't been as good as I'd hoped, and I'm still on the fence about cost/benefit. Here's a typical pro/con list after the first inning or so:  Some Pros: - The graphics. By far the most beautiful of the Sims games and with a slightly better create-a-sim interface, although see Cons below. The in-game look is terrific, especially the lighting, and the different ""worlds,"" which are really just neighborhoods your sim visits, load faster than they did in 3. This is because each neighborhood is small. Instead of forty lots and properties in one place that have to be loaded, you have maybe 12 places to each neighborhood with more neighborhoods, and travel is fast. The energy in the game was very clearly channeled into making everything look great and to take you much faster to a place you want to visit.  - The more sophisticated mood manager. There's a state-of-mind thing in the game beyond the basic needs. You can be inspired, happy, energized, focused, and the total package of moods has its own benefits. Neat idea.  - Bigger, smoother group gatherings. Putting a group together in the Sims 3 was always an iffy, glitchy, chaotic affair. S4 has a much better party function, including the Get Together expansion that has clubs you can join. Dancing is hilarious.  - Great expansion ideas, particularly having to do with environmental responsibility (but, there are too many expansions with too little content added to each one, so we're back to the money pit).  - Lots have a vibe to them. You can choose mood characteristics for a lot just as you do for a sim, so a lot can boost a sim's progress in certain pursuits.  - Cute little kids and pets (with an expansion) who show natural behaviors that are often funny and adorable.  - A few convenient streamlining decisions. Your sim doesn't have to wash every dish in the house anymore, for instance, although it's weird to have god (you) just pick up a dirty plate and ghost it into the trash can in a game all about chores and self care.  Pro/Con:  - The new content has some fun little surprises that weren't in S3, but these are often pros with cons attached. The objects in the new version have some neat interactions, although some of them simply don't do what they advertise. Patchy the Scarecrow, for instance, hangs out and watches TV--creepy--more often than doing anything in the garden. If you don't want a pal from a slasher movie then you want to keep him locked out of the house. When you hire a ""professional gardener"" the expensive contract worker stops by, waters a few plants, skips five other things that could be done, then charges you and goes home. But the bird feeder is fun.  - Too easy to botch a big decision. You need to be careful about how getting married works or it won't go as the interface implies with its vaguely-labeled choices. You might want to use YouTube or Twitch streams before you make any life-changing choices. I tend to micromanage my sims, so if you're fine to just watch the random behavior show and see what gets set on fire, then you'll like the autonomy on and the hold-my-beer nature of some of the commands.  I'm saying ""pro"" and writing ""con"" here. That sums up the Sims 4. You get nothing without paying for it in some way. My hope is that in time I'll just memorize which moments of programming stupidity I can get around.   Cons:  Some of these are pretty big. Gameplay in S3 was slow because of bugs. Gameplay in S4 is slow because your sims are simply dumber than bags of hammers.  - I don't know who decided that you can play the bejezus out of a piano but cannot for the life of you feed your toddler on less than four tries and two hours of wasted time, but the most basic element of The Sims since its invention has gotten a little lost--time management. You can't just pick up your toddler and walk downstairs with the kid. Oh, no. Takes hours unless you pick her up, indicate where you want to put her down, do that, then pick her up again to place her in the high chair, which may or may not happen, before you give her a bowl of generic food, which may be too confusing for your adult sim who understands music theory to accomplish in less than an hour. The kid in the game will likely be more patient with this than you are before she disintegrates into sadness and fills her pants because her other needs depleted while you were hammering away at meeting just the one.  A shower in this game can take all day. Sims stand in place or just do something else when you give them commands--that's with autonomy shut off. With it on they'll simply ignore what you want them to do. They collapse into instant mood meltdown because of a thunderstorm.  - There are tons of options for conversation, for things to buy, for things to do. And you will not be allowed to do them. Fascists designed this game. You have to reach level 10 of some profession to get an item. You have to be a comedian in order to become a musician. You have to figure out some puzzle sequence of interactions in order to achieve something that should be simple. If you like to cook and let your sims eat what they cook, they will be fat. You have to work out like the entire cast of Guardians of the Galaxy, including Rocket, in order to just keep the basic shape your sim had in create-a-sim for long stretches of that sim's life. Your wardrobe is still limited by function rather than just listing all the clothing and letting your sim wear what you want the sim to wear (without using cheats). The controlling nature of the design does not make the game ""more challenging"" unless you consider standing in a bread line with your government-issued ticket a fun challenge. You have to find your fun in a more zen way, just watching the neat stuff the game actually lets you do when the programming doesn't get in your way.  - You might like a game that works best only when you use certain cheats. I like a game that's programmed so you aren't constantly tempted to revert to cheats.  - You can't decide how long you want your sims to live. S3 had specific numbers of days you could set for stages of life. S4 just gives you ""short"" or ""long,"" and you have to squeeze in what is sometimes an unreachable goal into a life. S3 did some of this, too--the architect career track, for instance. Sadly, S4 didn't solve some time management problems from S3 in a time management game. I have read that you will likely never reach the top level of running a veterinary clinic before your sim dies, no matter how workaholic your sim is.  - S4 got rid of vehicles, which seems like another way to undercut The Sims rather than make it more... simmish. When you want to go to another neighborhood you just fade out and show up in some cloud of transcendental teleportation. There's a space ship. There isn't a junker for you to drive to work while you save up for the cool sportscar. Strange, and not cool.  - The price tag. It's hard to say you'll be getting what you want specifically from this game for less than $75 beyond the base game, even at the sale prices. Wait for the packs to go to at most $7.99 and wait for the game to age a little more so that the $40 expansions cost $25 or so.  - Origin. Does anyone like Origin? Is that possible? Origin is the capitalist goon element that EA never needed and that turns every experience into navigating a giant mall to find a restroom. When I load a game I want to play the game, not open the door to another Jehovah's Witness offering me another pamphlet. I paid my money, Origin.

1222670,2024-02-08,"The TS4 base game is free. You may look at it and figure that for a free game, surely it can't be that bad. But once you start playing, you will immediately begin to notice the cracks. Unlike previous Sims games, TS4 lacks depth and engaging gameplay, making the base game feel like an unfinished demo. Travelling anywhere requires loading screens, relationships are shallow, and the sim AI is frustrating and annoying. There is so little to do in this game. And naturally, you are going to begin to look at the packs, which the launcher advertises whenever you open the game. Buying packs is expensive. There are so many that it can be overwhelming to pick, especially since many of them seem like they add essential features that you need. And worst of all, purchasing these packs will not fix your game. It will actually make it worse. For every tiny bit of gameplay you will also have to put up with more annoyances, longer loading screens, and more bugs. And there will be many bugs. Some of them are bad enough to corrupt save files and crash the game. But because packs are so expensive, you try to convince yourself that it isn't so bad. You may even spend more money, and feel more indebted to this game. How could these packs be so expensive and so shallow, so broken? You may think it is your fault, that you are missing something, that you made the wrong purchases. And so it looks like the only escape from the hole is to dig deeper. EA is a company that does not care about this game. TS4 has so many game breaking bugs, and packs that have been broken since their release years ago. They have a long history of ignoring player complaints, refusing refunds, and continuing to push new content no matter the backlash. They have no accountability, because this game is too big for a few players to hold them responsible. Every trailer hypes up every new pack as a must buy, and after release EA goes radio silent until the next new pack, leaving players to struggle with their newly broken game, because each patch breaks things further. TS4 is 10 years old. It is not going to get any better. If you are in the market for a life simulation game, then you should look at any of the recent newer entries to the genre. If you download the base game, even though it is free, it will tempt you to buy these very well advertised packs that will break your game. The game engine was terrible to begin with, and piling more content on a broken foundation only makes things worse. There are two positives to this game: first, there is a very engaging build mode, and it's quite fun to design different houses in this game. There are still bugs, but they're minimal if you don't have a lot of packs, and you can take some beautiful designs and share them on the public gallery for others to download. Second, TS4 has a huge dedicated modding community, so if you're playing on PC and can mod your game then you can get so much engaging and interesting content for free thanks to the work of these talented players. I don't think they're enough to make this a good game, but you may feel differently. If you already own the game and are thinking of buying a pack, three rules to follow: 1) look up several gameplay videos. Make sure they're complete, with no cuts to hide bugs or annoyances. There's a million different Sims channels on Youtube, so do your research. 2) Never buy a pack full price. There are enough sales that you can wait until it's at least half off. 3) NEVER preorder a pack. They will try to entice you with exclusive content, but it is not worth it. New packs are always broken and may not get fixed for months, if at all. But if you don't own this game, don't get it. The sunk cost fallacy is the main reason for this game's success, and EA have very good advertisements and a huge online community to encourage you to spend a little more. Maybe this time the game will be worth it. Maybe this time they'll be different. But after 10 years of consistency, maybe its time to accept that there never was a good game here, and it's time to let go.",92.2,Not Recommended,183,ts4 base game free may look figure free game surely bad start play immediately begin notice crack unlike previous sims game ts4 lack depth engage gameplay make base game feel like unfinished demo travel anywhere require load screen relationship shallow sims ai frustrate annoy little game naturally go begin look dlc launcher advertise whenever open game buying dlc expensive many overwhelm pick especially since many seem like add essential feature need bad purchase dlc fix game actually make bad every tiny bit gameplay also put annoyance longer load screen bug many bug bad enough corrupt save file crash game dlc expensive try convince bad may even spend money feel indebted game dlc expensive shallow broken may think fault miss something make wrong purchase look like escape hole dig deep ea company care game ts4 many game break bug dlc break since release year ago long history ignore player complaint refuse refund continue push new content matter backlash accountability game big player hold responsible every trailer hype every new dlc must buy release ea go radio silent next new dlc leave player struggle newly break game patch break thing ts4 year old go get good market life simulation game look recent newer entry genre download base game even though free tempt buy well advertised dlc break game game engine terrible begin pile content broken foundation make thing bad two positive game first engaging buildmode mode quite fun design different house game still bug minimal lot dlc take beautiful design share public gallery others download second ts4 huge dedicated mod community play pc mod game get much engaging interesting content free thanks work talented player think enough make good game may feel differently already game think buy dlc three rule follow look several gameplay video make sure complete cut hide bug annoyance million different sims channel youtube research never buy dlc full price enough sale wait least half never preorder dlc try entice exclusive content worth new dlc always break may get fix month game get sunk cost fallacy main reason game success ea good advertisement huge online community encourage spend little maybe time game worth maybe time different year consistency maybe time accept never good game time let go

It's just enough to whet your appetite and get you primed and ready to buy whatever they're trying to sell you. Only instead of getting a full pack of the sampler cheese they're trying to sell you sampler size bits of the cheese at full cheese pack sizes. Sane people don't buy into this ♥♥♥♥ because who willingly pays money for samplers? The same thing goes for this game.  The game is free but it isn't a game, not really. It's a peek through a window into a shopping center. It's perfect looking pintrest photos of things you want but can't afford. Then when you get whatever you're pining for you realize you've been had. In any other game you could've gotten just as much content for 1/7th the price. The problem is that there aren't many other games like this. It's not ridiculous to say that The Sims series has a monopoly on sandbox life sims, and that's why they get away with selling you bite sized DLC packs or flavor packs for the same price as feature length games sometimes! Besides the ethical problems this game is littered with bugs and weird menu problems. I've had my entire created household be deleted twice in a row for no reason other than I got booted back to the menu for some update. Why can't I save character's? Why does it have to be the whole household? Why can't I save a household until I buy land? Why does the save household feature just not work at all sometimes?  Don't get me wrong though this game is fun, really. It's just that getting to where you can have the maximum enjoyment you can out of it requires you to pour an obscene amount of money into EAs guts.

1222670,2020-06-26,"TL;DR: This review focuses on The Sims 4 DLCs because I believe they're necessary for a fun experience, but they're expensive. If you can't or won't spend twice the cost of the main game on DLCs, I can't recommend the game.   I won't go into detail about how The Sims 4 works because most people know how these games function. But, I want to mention that this game doesn't have an open world like The Sims 3, and the worlds are much smaller. However, the game has decent content, but it can feel empty without DLCs. So, if you plan to buy The Sims 4, I recommend purchasing a few DLCs. It's costly, but I think it's necessary to enjoy the game.  Below are some DLCs that I recommend, but only if they're on sale (at least 30% off). I only recommend DLCs that I have played or know are good.  Tiny Living Stuff: This is a cheap and fun DLC. It allows you to build super small houses with compact furniture, making it possible to fit 5 to 6 houses on the same lot. It's unique and adds a new dimension to the game.  Seasons: This DLC adds four seasons with holidays, new items, and activities. It also adds new weather and ways to die. (Pro tip: you can kill your simmers really fast in a frozen pool.)  Get Famous: This is a decent DLC for its price, especially when it's on sale. It's great if you care about fame and money, and you need this DLC to become an actor.  Get To Work: This DLC is a must-have, as it adds active careers to the game, the option to become a store owner, and hospital visits.  ""Cats & Dogs is the only DLC I own but unfortunately cannot recommend. I felt compelled to mention it, as it's typically the go-to expansion pack for new players, and with good reason - it was highly regarded in previous Sims titles. However, in The Sims 4, it adds little content beyond cats and dogs and is plagued with numerous bugs. Adopted pets often become stuck, leaving players struggling to figure out how to properly care for them.""  In conclusion, I like The Sims 4. It's more alive in interactions than any of the previous Sims games, and the building and character creation is user-friendly. However, the cost of DLCs is quite steep, and it's frustrating that some of them aren't worth the price.  ____________",124.6,Recommended,200,tl dr review focus sims dlc believe necessary fun experience expensive spend twice cost main game dlc recommend game go detail sims work people know game function want mention game open world like sims world much small however game decent content feel empty without dlc plan buy sims recommend purchase dlc costly think necessary enjoy game dlc recommend sale least recommend dlc play know good tiny living stuff cheap fun dlc allow buildmode super small house compact furniture make possible fit house lot unique add new dimension game season dlc add four season holiday new item activity also add new weather way die pro tip kill simmer really fast frozen pool get famous decent dlc price especially sale great care fame money need dlc become actor get work dlc must add active career game option become store owner hospital visit cat dog dlc unfortunately recommend felt compel mention typically go dlc dlc new player good reason highly regard previous sims title however sims add little content beyond cat dog plague numerous bug adopt pet often become stuck leave player struggle figure properly care conclusion like sims alive interaction previous sims game building character creation user friendly however cost dlc quite steep frustrate worth price ____________

1222670,2020-11-30,"Abu labl dabukatu abab gugaloobaboo  After years of waiting Sims 4 is on steam finally. I've waited for this day so much. Sims 4 is a perfect game to relax or just failing at your sim life just like your real life. Or maybe you want to realize your broken dreams or deepest desires? Play it then.  It's good old sims but unfortunately it has some bad old problems. Since the very first game I couldn't understand and it was annoying me badly, why the time goes so fast that you spend half of the day in the bathroom, making meals and eating. But this so far the only one significant negative point I could think of.  Character creation is greatly improved. You have much more freedom to create your character. You can alter your body greatly, adjust the weight, lots of customization options and if you add mods you basically can create whoever you like. There's also gender options&preferences so LGBT people won't feel neglected here. You can also pick few perks for your sim, positive or negative it's up to you, your life goal, your temper and so on. There's a lot replayability value in this game due to how different your sim can be each time.  After creating your sim as you already know you pick the house and start your life. There are life goals, job, relationships. My favorite activity so far is beating my neighbor every few days. I don't know why, anger issues probably. Of course most the time passes when you're at work and sleeping so just like in real life there's not a lot of time left for something else. Feeling tired and don't want to start talking with people? Go troll teh forums. Or give money to charity...which apparently was a scam. Then go outside beat your neighbor again and insult him. Then go play piano while other people do pushups beside you. Come back home call the girl, have some fun time, eat leftovers and go to sleep. Or maybe you want to live in a cute world by building your perfect house decorated with unicorns and rainbows?  Ok lets get serious. The map is pretty small and while there's a lot to do and achieve there's still too little content. I kind of understand and agree with DLC expansions. This is not a yearly franchise, the game is supported for years so having DLC's is not a bad practice, plenty of very successful games do that and community loves them. They add content you might be interested and you're not forced to buy a new game each year. From seasons, pets to vampires. There's also some cosmetic DLC's which are not necessary at all. I love this DLC model but the problem with it is the pricing. DLC's a greatly overpriced. Yes it's good letting you choose what you want while supporting developers, but seriously these prices are insane. DLC's like seasons, university, pets should either be included in the game or sold at much lower prices. The ones like star Wars or Vampires are different thing, they feel out of context and more resembles real additional content. Not everyone is interested in those so it makes sense selling them separately and maybe at slightly higher price.  There's a lot of dialogue options and actions so you can approach different people as you wish. Maybe there could be slightly more choices, but it's not bad. I don't know if it's just me but managing needs feels easier in Sims 4. In previous games I had problems with various needs besides bladder and hunger of course. Here I can easily keep my Sim happy.  Modding community is HUGE for this game. There are really good mods out there, mostly cosmetic stuff but you can even mod drugs, violence, murder and sex of course. It all depends on your taste but I associate Sims with innocent and cute game for escaping the real world so mods like this seems out of place. But hey they are there and it could be fun from time to time.  Graphically the game is wonderful. It's far from revolutionary on a technical side obviously, but it looks great for its art-style and overall aesthetics. Small details like emotions, food, your PC screen and other small things have enough detail. Performance is very good. It runs smoothly without any lag or stuttering. This was the reason why I couldn't play Sims 3, even after applying all the fixes the lagging was annoying. Ultrawide is supported out of the box. I'm playing on 3700x, 2070s, 32GB @3440x1440 and getting 90+ fps.  Sound same as graphics is great. Talking is usual Sims blabbering in alien language which is really funny, but you can easily understand if the Sim is angry, happy etc. from the tone of his voice. There's also music. You can listen to radio or play music yourself. There are few genres to choose from but I miss metal of course and maybe more songs overall. Playing instruments sounds so good, sometimes I slow the time and just listen. Great songs there.  If you love Sims it's obviously a good choice because there's simply no other game which would offer something like this. But the main game lacks content so you probably will need couple of DLC's to enrich the fun or maybe simple mods will be enough. Anyway at a sale price it's a no brainer. One thing i really wish and that would very simple to add are achievements, please EA do it.",150.3,Recommended,233,abu labl dabukatu abab gugaloobaboo year wait sims steam finally wait day much sims perfect game relax fail sims life like real life maybe want realize broken dream deep desire play good old sims unfortunately bad old problem since first game understand annoy badly time go fast spend half day bathroom making meal eat far one significant negative point think character creation greatly improve much freedom create character alter body greatly adjust weight lot customization option add mods basically create whoever like also gender option preference lgbt people feel neglect also pick perk sims positive negative life goal temper lot replayability value game due different sims time create sims already know pick house start life life goal job relationship favorite activity far beat neighbor every day know anger issue probably course time pass work sleep like real life lot time leave something else feeling tired want start talk people go troll teh forum give money charity apparently scam go outside beat neighbor insult go play piano people pushup beside come back home call girl fun time eat leftover go sleep maybe want livemode cute world buildmode perfect house decorate unicorn rainbows ok let get serious map pretty small lot achieve still little content kind understand agree dlc dlc yearly franchise game support year dlc bad practice plenty successful game community love add content might interested force buy new game year season pet vampire also cosmetic dlc necessary love dlc model problem pricing dlc greatly overpriced yes good letting choose want support developer seriously price insane dlc like season university pet either include game sell much low price one like star war vampire different thing feel context resembles real additional content everyone interested make sense sell separately maybe slightly high price lot dialogue option action approach different people wish maybe slightly choice bad know manage need feel easier sims previous game problem various need besides bladder hunger course easily keep sims happy mod community huge game really good mods mostly cosmetic stuff even mod drug violence murder sex course depend taste associate sims innocent cute game escape real world mods like seem place hey fun time time graphically game wonderful far revolutionary technical side obviously look great art style overall aesthetic small detail like emotion food pc screen small thing enough detail performance good run smoothly without lag stutter reason play sims even apply fix lagging annoy ultrawide support box play 3700x 2070s 32gb 3440x1440 get fps sound graphic great talk usual sims blabber alien language really funny easily understand sims angry happy tone voice also music listen radio play music genre choose miss metal course maybe song overall playing instrument sound good sometimes slow time listen great song love sims obviously good choice simply game offer something like main game lack content probably need couple dlc enrich fun maybe simple mods enough anyway sale price brainer one thing really wish simple add achievement please ea

1222670,2021-08-26,"I was a big fan of the first game of the series and had a lot of fun with custom content, which you could download from fan sites. The Sims 4 is definitely not bad, but lacks a soul element. Most of the mechanics are still the same, or have been improved, but there are some weird choices (e.g. building a spaceship in your backyard) and some wackiness that seem too far off.  That would be all okay though. What kills it, runs it over, beats it to a pulp, sets it on fire and then buries it in forty-five different graves is the business model of the game. The base price is 40€, currently with 45 DLCs, divided into - expansion packs = 40€ each - game packs = 20€ each - content kit = 5€ each - ""stuff"" packs = 10€ each (there might be some other BS I'm missing)  The developers made it so that The Sims 4 has become more an online store for online furniture than a game.

1222670,2021-04-07,"The Sims 3 is also on Steam, and it's cheaper. Just something to consider.  tl;dr: it's fun enough to be worth getting the base game and some expansions on sale, but, if you have the willpower, it's probably better to be a conscientious objector and not encourage EA's scummy practices by giving them money for this--although there are enough sim simps that I doubt your righteous protest will be enough to make a difference in the long run.  Anyway,  I'd recommend this one still if you get it on sale. The base game goes on sale for as low as $5 at times, and, while it's lackluster, it's worth at least that much. And the 2000 expansion, game, and stuff packs also get on pretty good deals sometimes. Even then, you'll still feel like you're spending too much money, but it won't hurt as much.  The thing is, the game is fun. The packs are underdeveloped and overpriced, but most of them are still fun in their own ways. The devs really knocked it out of the park by making a game that's both so poorly-developed that it's infuriating but also still fun enough that you'll be willing to still play it and shell out money for at least some expansions out of the hope that they'll fix the game.  The DLC model of the game is abysmal. So many of the packs are things that should absolutely have been in the base game or at least added as a free update--like Seasons, Get Together, Cats & Dogs, and Parenthood to name a few. Like, this game is all about interactions and relationships between people. They didn't flesh out the parent/child aspect of the game enough, and they want us to shell out an extra $20 for them to make it marginally better? Gtfo.  The game is fun, and its vibrant modding community of people that love this game more than the devs makes it better, but it's also incredibly disappointing.

1222670,2020-12-28,"My Review of The Sims 4.  The Sims 4 is arguably seen as the worst of the Sims titles. It gets a bad rep from those who prefer the previous titles. Let’s jump into this further.  Here are some features and game mechanics that people usually bring up and that I personally miss.  1. Create-A-Style The ability to change the texture, colour and material of surfaces and clothes for extended customization.  2. Sliders for Create-A-Sim Another staple in The Sims 3 CAS was the ability to tweak the colour of your Sim’s skin and make-up to almost anything you desired giving you yet more customization and personality.  3. Open Worlds This feature was a staple in the Sims series. It gave you the ability to move across the entire world, and see other Sims interacting with things around them. It gave the world more depth.  4. Trait System In the Sims 2 and 3, you had a plethora of traits that you could assign your Sim giving them a more complex and realistic personality.  This isn't really a feature commonly explored in the Sims series, but it was there in tandem with the expansion packs if you so wished to pursue.  Okay…so…The Sims 4 has a few technical limitations and is missing some features from previous titles that we all know and love, but people tend to highlight the faults and failures and gloss over the positives. Here are some of my personal favourites.  Sims no longer all look the same! Did you ever notice that Sims in 2 and 3* all looked a bit similar? There weren’t many facial features or structures for you to mould to your liking. The new* click-and-drag feature in Create-A-Sim gives you so much more pliability and with preset facial features to play with, you can make something really unique. For further detail I would recommend watching  Creating the perfect home has never been easier. It’s now so more fun to build than ever, and with Build & Buy Mode merged into one it’s a more fluid experience. For more detail I would recommend watching  A new art style that I believe harkens back to the roots of classic style of The Sims. While The Sims 3 tried to go for the more realistic overtones, it didn’t succeed very well and sadly stepped into the uncanny valley.  Most* interactions are more believable. The new feature of being to multi-task is quite handy…and while it isn’t perfect, it still makes some* interactions more realistic and fluid rather than waiting for the next thing in the queue to happen.  Unlike The Sims 3, 4* is extremely well optimized. I tested this on of my lowest-spec laptops and at maximum settings it hardly dropped in frames. Granted 3* goes for the more realistic approach but can be costly.  I think we should talk about the elephant in the room, and that is overpriced, overvalued expansion and game packs. EA have always made bad business decisions that have deterred their customers from this franchise. The one that stands out the most is the marketing DLC. In my personal opinion and the opinion of others, game packs are marketed at exorbitant prices, some costing even more than base game’s value. Believe it or not, this is still an issue even with The Sims 3. Game packs don’t seem to have decreased in value over the span of 12 years. This definitely threw me off initially…but I’m a sucker for interesting DLC.  When disputing the bad business decisions, please do not confuse EA with Maxis. EA are the publishers and the ones in charge of business.

1222670,2020-07-03,"The base game is deplorable in the complete lack of content it brings, and is virtually unplayable by itself. The game can however be really fun with the addition of a few good DLCs on sale and mods.  Here are the ones I recommend vs. don't recommend having played with most of the expansions except eco lifestyle.  Highly recommended:  1. Sims 4 Get Together: The most underrated sims expansion pack. Allows you to create unique mini-communities that your sim would be part of, either it be family, or coworkers, or hobby groups. Super useful in everyday game play. I use it to make family gatherings, after work hangouts, holiday parties...etc. The groups also allow you to modify other sim's behaviour based on your expectations which really adds realism to the game play.  2. Sims 4 Cats & Dogs: Pets in the sims are a favourite of mine. Sucks that we don't have horses like the sims 3 but I am overall very happy with the cats & dogs expansion and I like the new vet career as well.  3. Sims 4 Seasons: Self-explanatory. Adds seasons to your game. Sims behave differently based on different seasons. Also adds holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day etc. Highly recommend for varied game play.  4. Sims 4 Parenthood: Adds activities to toddlers, children & teens in the game. Allows sims to parent their kids. You can give kids chores, ground them, reward & punish them for specific behaviours etc and these actions will have impacts on your child develops. More importantly, this is a game pack so it is only half of the price of the expansion packs.  5. Sims 4 Dine Out: Same logic as parenthood. Allows your sim to eat at restaurants & also manage your own restaurant. One of my personal favourites. One of the better game packs. You can get a lot of hours out of this pack. Also super good for rags to riches challenges.    1. Sims 4 City Living: Allows you to live in cities and brings apartments to the game. Also adds various festivals to the game which are good outing spots. Really good expansion pack but ranked lower because I don't like how in the sims 4 they split sims 3 late night into three expansion packs - city living, get famous, and vampires.  2. Sims 4 Get Famous: Allows you to become famous actor, streamer & DJ. Adds new world which is equivalent to LA in the real world with gated communities and hot venues. Really enjoyed the actor and streamer careers and I think the concept of the pack is good. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed playing with fame in previous sims games. Again ranked lower because I don't like how they split one expansion pack into three expansion packs.  3. Sims 4 University: Allows sims to go to university. Not essential to game play since sim's don't really need degree to get jobs in the sims 4. However, it is well made and recommended for people who enjoyed the university expansions in the previous sims entries.  4. Sims 4 Realm of Magic + Vampires: Essentially EA broke up Sims 4 Supernaturals and sold them in individual game packs, which is good in my opinion because then you can just purchase the occult sims that you were interested in. The realm of magic and vampire game packs actually went into each occult sim (wizard & vampires) in more details that the Sims 3 in my opinion. Rank medium because I think occult sims are not essential to game play but they are really fun and I would recommend picking up these two game packs when you get the chance.    1. Sims 4 Island Living: Allows you to travel to the island world of Sulani. Adds mermaid to the game. In my opinion this should have been a game pack instead of an expansion pack. I am disappointed that they took out the resort management system that was in Sims 3 Island Paradise and I do not think this expansion much content compared to the other ones.  2. Sims 4 Get to Work: Adds several playable careers to the game including doctor, scientist, and detective. The careers are actually really fun, especially on the first few play throughs. The drawback is that the tasks gets repetitive after a while so I wish more variety was added to the mid to high stages of the career.  3. Sims 4 Jungle Adventure: Sims 3 world adventures turned into a game pack. Adds archeology into the game. Good pack but ranked lower because limited replayability and also doesn't appeal to everyone.  4. Sims 4 Tiny Living Stuff, Laundry Day Stuff, & Romantic Garden Stuff: The top of the stuff packs. Tiny living stuff because it adds interesting concepts & objects to the game. Laundry stuff because it was a community voted pack and the build items in that pack are awesome. Romantic garden stuff because it adds good landscaping objects.    1. Sims 4 Spa Day. Outdoor Retreat, Bowling Night: Will use once or twice. Not that important to game play.  2. All the other stuff packs and whatnot: $$$ packs by EA. Only recommended for avid fans of the series who have a lot of $$ to spend.    1. Sims 4 Luxury Party Stuff: Almost $1 per item. Do NOT get unless you already got it. Ugly items that you will never use.  2. Sims 4 Strangerville: Not a bad idea but zero replay value once you've been through it once. Use your money on some other game if you must get it.  3. Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle: Reviews have been horrible. There are many bugs reported online. Community action plans are a HOT mess. Do not get it until EA fixes it.",616.2,Recommended,77,base game deplorable complete lack content bring virtually unplayable game however really fun addition good dlc sale mods one recommend vs recommend play dlc except eco lifestyle highly recommend sims get together underrated sims dlc dlc allow create unique mini community sims part either family coworkers hobby group super useful everyday game play use make family gathering work hangout holiday party group also allow modify sims behaviour base expectation really add realism game play sims cat dogs pet sims favourite mine suck horse like sims overall happy cat dog dlc like new vet career well sims season self explanatory add season game sims behave differently base different season also add holiday like thanksgiving christmas valentine day highly recommend varied game play sims parenthood add activity toddler child teen game allow sims parent kid give kid chore grind reward punish specific behaviour action impact child develop importantly game dlc half price dlc dlc sims dine logic parenthood allow sims eat restaurant also manage restaurant one personal favourite one good game dlc get lot hour dlc also super good rag rich challenge sims city living allow livemode city bring apartment game also add various festival game good out spot really good dlc dlc rank low like sims split sims late night three dlc dlc city living get famous vampires sims get famous allows become famous actor streamer dj add new world equivalent la real world gated community hot venue really enjoy actor streamer career think concept dlc good highly recommend anyone enjoy play fame previous sims game rank low like split one dlc dlc three dlc dlc sims university allow sims go university essential game play since sims really need degree get job sims however well make recommend people enjoy university dlc previous sims entry sims realm magic vampire essentially ea break sims supernatural sell individual game dlc good opinion purchase occult sims interested realm magic vampire game dlc actually go occult sims wizard vampire detail sims opinion rank medium think occult sims essential game play really fun recommend pick two game dlc get chance sims island living allow travel island world sulani add mermaid game opinion game dlc instead dlc dlc disappoint take resort management system sims island paradise think dlc much content compare one sims get work add several playable career game include doctor scientist detective career actually really fun especially first play throughs drawback task get repetitive wish variety add mid high stage career sims jungle adventure sims world adventure turn game dlc add archeology game good dlc rank low limited replayability also appeal everyone sims tiny livemode stuff laundry day stuff romantic garden stuff top stuff dlc tiny living stuff add interesting concept object game laundry stuff community vote dlc buildmode item dlc awesome romantic garden stuff add good landscaping object sims spa day outdoor retreat bowling night use twice important game play stuff dlc whatnot dlc ea recommend avid fan series lot spend sims luxury party stuff almost per item get unless already get ugly item never use sims strangerville bad idea zero replay value use money game must get sims eco lifestyle review horrible many bug report online community action plan hot mess get ea fix
1222670,2020-06-22,"Wow.. So where to begin?  I'm not much of a The Sims fan, but I've played 1 and 2 and had fun with them for a while. Also, I'm not much of a gamer nowadays since I'm a father, having a job, and time is kinda limited to spend on my dear hobby. Nevertheless I felt obligated to post my first review because of this game.  This was mostly an impulse purchase because, as I said, I did enjoy The Sims 1 and 2 and I have some money to burn, but I'm happy with steam and aren't that keen on installing other storefronts because of a game - though, when I started up the game and saw that you needed to install origin on top of Steam I thought, -""eh, ok. I've already purchased the game so.. you win this time EA"". Sure.. I think it's scummy that you need to install one storefront on top of another storefront just to play the game but, for this instance, I gave it a pass.  I don't like EA. I haven't liked EA in a long while. I'm old enough to remember a time that when you saw that EA logo appearing on the screen you knew that Wing commander, NHL 97, Syndicate, Budokan... for crying out loud.. The list is long.  So. Starting up the game went smoothly, as it should, and I thought that, Went to the store to buy said DLC and I almost choked on my newly poured cup of coffee.  Over $500!! effing USD to own all the DLC!??? That's FIVEHUNDRED US DOLLAROONIES!! And that is THE 30% OFF!? I could buy a freaking for that amount!  Needless to say, I uninstalled the game, the origin launcher and am right now demanding a refund. I knew that EA were scummy nowadays, but man. I just hope that the poor souls that purchase all the DLC actually can afford it and are not feeding their addiction with money they don't have. This is acting just as crappy as all the mobile gacha games that are overflowing the market right now, but instead of characters they offer you chairs, tables and pets. I'm honestly surprised that they haven't incorporated lootboxes at this point.   And this is having a score on steam? I just shake my head...  Good riddance  *Edit* Forgot to mention. I would gladly pay $40-50 USD for a ""Complete Edition"".

1222670,2021-12-06,"Thank you for the helpfuls and awards. I'm glad I was able to, in some way, assist you in your endeavor ^.^   21 Jan 2025 (Hours, add about 1000 to my current total for Sims 4. Steam doesn't show EA's stats)  They've changed the main screen for the game, drastically. Just a heads up if you are expecting the old main screen. Some folks don't like it, and some do. They separated the challenges from regular play (yay). So, you have a choice now. ♥ My game has a small handful of mods. Not many. My game runs fine. Sometimes when launching, EA needs to update and restart. Otherwise, no issues other than the typical.    Another Update: Wanted to warn anyone buying all DLC, it may include Horse Ranch twice? It is listed on the main page twice (see below for my concerns that I posted back then). I'm not sure how it works, but I wanted to warn you. It may duplicate in the cost?  I'd like to also add that they removed girlfriend/boyfriend & husband/wife. You must conform. O.o (They could've just added spouse and partner instead of replacing the originals.) I'm very disappointed in the frequent undesired changes in the game compared to before. Also Note: EA App is also Required   Wanted to warn anyone who may actually be tempted to buy all DLC. The Horse Ranch DLC is listed twice. Near the top and near the bottom.  w/ latest updates and EA Software being forced on us, Origin is gone :( And they now require us to use their EA Software. With this in mind, I've commented in a thread and want to re-post what I posted there concerning trying to launch the game with steam and how it reacts to EA Software and launching the game itself.   UPDATE: Seems if you clear cache and just close down both steam and ea, then reboot your PC that you can then launch it from steam but I recommend you open them both before you launch via steam. I tried from desktop and that did not launch EA Software properly. IDK if adding EA Software to Steam's Programs would help but I worry it'll affect play time documented, which is cool to see.  Update 2: I tried again today. I do my typical routine of steam stuff. I then go to launch the game and so it begins. I've tried verify integrity. I've tried clearing cache on both EA Software & Steam Cache. Both cause you to have to log in again. Even then I get that error, 500 and I'll know it'll be an issue before I even get to see my game page in EA Software because EA Software will launch with a yellow banner stating something is off. If the EA Software launches and does NOT have that yellow banner, it seems to launch each time. Once I get the game going I do not go messing with it so these tests are some time in between. I hope that helps some of you until it's fixed. I also sent an error report in EA Software (Desktop software aka EA App/Program) for PC.  Restarting pc after clearing cache? IDK but that's a lot of steps. Restarting does and is part of what makes it work. The lack of yellow banner is also a part of what makes it work. Yellow banner means my game information will not be accessible because of some mysterious situation. O.o    31 Jan 2023: Newest BASE GAME update includes surgical marks for sex changes and medical clothing for gender changes. The one thing I did notice is patches that can be worn on the skin. That could be for diabetics or heart patients? I still wish it was a free DLC, then you could get more medical supplies, braces, etc. I think they added this one more for political reasons, to make a point. I prefer a free DLC of medical, or a low fee. I'd buy it as a medical care kit, if it were that. (Note: there's also no prosthetic limbs & you'll have to pay for the dentures in a cup) I think it was just a way to get their way, tbh. This is my personal opinion.  *I'd love a toggle to remove all in CAS (Create A Sim) But that does not exist. :( And they throw a bunch of stuff on the sims. It will take quite a while before you can even begin to design them due to needing to remove things.  I've loved sims since sims 1 (Will Wright brought it to us through someone who could help him bring his vision to life, from what I understand. The dream of seeing inside Sim City's homes. Sims 2 forward it was a bit different. Check out the wikiipedia on it if you want more information on The Sims Franchise, early days and publishers.  I've played each version and have seen how it has grown, as well as their greed :( (Sorry EA but it is true.. *Sad face*) Still waiting.  Sims 4 is a really fun life simulation game with tons of mods available out there if you prefer. (just be safe with those!)  I like to go to ModTheSims for mods and to Carl's Sims 4 Site for the Cheats and Tips for gameplay.   Both sites are loaded with information! MTS is also for previous versions of sims. :)    You can record in-game play and hitting tab while playing will hide the HUD. (full screen recordings)   The game was $500 to get all, but since that review it is over $1000 :( :( So I removed what I had wrote about the enough for a car part. Now, enough for . a lot.     The game is free here @ STEAM, and the packs can be bought from either. I used a Guide here on STEAM to make them linked. I moved all files over to STEAM so it's in one place. :D  If you want a big hospital that is mostly realistic, works in game if you use freebuild cheat, check out my upload (Origin Username: XTSMasterID) I don't have a lot but I'm starting to share more. :) I follow for follow in there ♥ As long as I know. But some are ""anonymous""?? why? I've no clue.  (The first Upload of the hospital, 2015)  (I've a friend who tested this. Said it worked great for them as a hospital but you MUST use that cheat to make it work right)    Please read other reviews for details and other perspectives. ♥  It will not show your Origin hours, sadly. I have over 900 hours in this game but it only shows the base game for here and it's time.. Just head over to Origin if you own Origin and you'll see your previous hours there, as well as updated hours if you have the steam version. :) Origin should have all hours displayed though Steam only picks up when you buy STEAM base game. Origin also shows which packs you own (it shows if it's a STEAM purchase as well) so check Origin when you want to know what packs you don't have. Steam doesn't seem to be able to track that. Then go to STEAM store and ignore what you already own so you don't buy it again.  I'd like to add for those who liked Mortimer and Bella Goth, they are in here. I've not seen Don Lothario (some of you know who I speak of). For more information, look up Lothario Definition in Google *wink* It'll explain why I am curious if he's in the game and why I look for him. Another hint is the hot air balloon in ?

1222670,2020-06-23,"This review is for those people wanting to move their sims 4 game across to Steam:  There are plenty of reviews online about the differences between sims 4 and other versions, this review is for current sims 4 players who want to play their game on Steam rather than Origin.  The first thing you'll notice is you have to purchase the base game A SECOND TIME in order to play via steam. Not. Cool. EA. I have moved games from different platforms to steam many times and it was always free, this added expense is unnecessary and outright stealing from loyal players. - so, I suggest you grab the base game on steam when it's on sale if this is still the rout you want to take.  The process of transferring will require you to uninstall your Origin version of The Sims 4 and re-install a Steam version of The Sims 4 (still in origin). That's right, you will still need origin to play the game. If you were hoping to ditch the origin platform think again! - this makes it almost pointless purchasing via steam if you already have the game on Origin. For first time players of the sims however I recommend purchasing via steam, just cos steam is awesome!  The Origin platform is less invasive when playing the steam version of The Sims 4, just sign in once to origin when you start up the game for the first time and from that point forward you may launch the game via steam and the origin platform will not be an issue. (allow your DLC to install before launching any pre-saved games or you may corrupt your saves (make save game backups b4 changing to the steam version! Just in case)) – your saves will be in exactly the same place as the Origin version of steam: documents/electronic arts/the sims 4/saves.  On a positive note you will not need to re-purchase any of your DLC - thank you! thank you! thank you! I'm so glad they have allowed this. But I'm not sure any DLC will be purchasable via steam at this point, all DLC may need to be purchased via the Origin platform. so again, why bother getting the steam version of the game if you already have it on origin along with all your DLC?  One reason you may want the steam version is to take advantage of the Steam Overlay. You can stream and chat with fellow steam owners from the steam overlay in game. (still not a selling point though since you can do just that by adding The Sims 4 as a non-steam game on steam… I think the overlay works when you do this but I’m not sure), somebody please check and comment thanks!  Another reason you may want The Sims 4 on steam is to take advantage of the steam achievements and badges. Yes, The Sims 4 on steam has badges! Go get your ranks up everybody!!  I guess it all comes down to WHY you want The Sims 4 on steam, if you just prefer steam than by all means, get the sims 4 on steam, transfer everything across, Bob’s your uncle. It supports the steam community, so if you do, thank you! If you don’t have the cash to purchase the base game a second time than it’s probably not worth it. If you don’t care about steam achievements, badges or the steam overlay, it’s probably not worth it. If all you want to do is uninstall the Origin platform and play on steam… well you can’t, so get over it!  IMO I got the game on steam because I like steam, I like being on steam, I’ve always wanted to have The Sims 4 on steam, and I think EA have made a pretty good compromise here, they are giving us what we want but still getting what they want. (They probably just want more money – so long as Steam is somehow benefiting from this deal than meh!

1222670,2021-11-25,"Playing the Sims is great, it's a childhood classic, brings me back to when I first entered the world of PC games.  It gets depressing around 4am when I realise I've been playing for hours on end, sat by myself, playing the life of someone who is more successful, funnier, more attractive, wealthier and generally better off than me, living in my dream house.

1222670,2021-09-27,"I only played original The Sims over twenty years ago. That says something about my age, doesn’t it. I didn’t think I’d ever come back to the series. Lately I checked out new early access game The Tenants which borrows some Sims mechanics and that was what reignited my curiosity after so much time.  Many things have already been said about EA’s greediness. I haven’t seen this amount of DLC for any other game I played, especially not as overpriced. Good thing is you definitely don’t need all of them. Many of the stuff packs is just minor cosmetics. As far as expansion packs and game packs go, below is an exhaustive list of essentials which will make your base game experience richer. Only first three are a necessity:  Seasons — for having… well, seasons, and a calendar of events throughout the year      Juggling between EA Play subscription, Steam bundle offers and major sale events (happen 2-3 times a year) you can complete your desired set much cheaper than the asking price. Other DLC can be looked into every now and then. It’s definitely not needed all at once from the beginning.  As a person who only played back in 2000 I quite like this fourth instalment in 2021. I know it’s already seven years old, and it took a long time for it to be where it is right now. Non-overwhelming interface, responsive controls, fairly big selection of build/buy items (lately Maxis added over 1000 new colour swatches to over 120 base game items). Game works great on SSD, GTX1060 and a five year old CPU. Steam integration is flawless, Origin starts quickly in the background and shuts down automatically right after you close the game. I could only wish for Steam achievements.  I like that this game can be played in so many ways – shoutout to all you fantastic builders out there! – but also in terms of using/not using cheats or creating different starting scenarios. I like Sims’ traits, aspirations and whims which add more to the gameplay. I very much like the inclusivity. The one aspect that surprised me the most in a positive way is gardening. I also love the overall sense of humour, not only in regards to gardening. How about growing that Cowplant, anyone? Or maybe a Money Tree is more up your alley, huh?  Be warned – once you’re hooked, three hours of your real life will fly by like an hour, and this is still an understatement.

Steam was able to let me do that finally and extremely easily! So far I'm really enjoying it and learning a lot. Also, I like the Steam interface and the befits of being able to connect with friends on Steam while gaming and I'm expecting easy mod downloads with workshop.

It lacks the necessary game play elements that made the other games lively (meaningful events, depth to sims, focus on all generations rather than just young adults, memories, ect). I'll keep playing it, but only with the help of mods.  The packs are just as disappointing. Discover Universities doesn't work with rotational game play, the Vampires and Making Magic expansions had some pretty great innovations to the magic systems, but the neighborhood was too small. Get to Work was fun, but the store part of the expansion can't run unless you're actually there and at the store. Dine Out is buggy, and it takes hours for sims to eat their food, but at least it kinda works. Cottage Living is actually great, and it has just as much content as the trailers showed if not more. Wedding Stories, on the other hand, does not. Plumbella's recent videos showed that it wouldn't even start the wedding sometimes, and even if the wedding goes off without a problem, there's no opportunity for drama! You can't leave people at the altar, you can express doubts about getting married but it's a positive interaction, and there's no aspirations. It feels very flat, especially when compared to the trailer.  If you are going to buy the game, get it on sale. Even then it's a toss up whether you'll be getting everything you paid for, or if you'll be disappointed. You'll be paying for buggy content that might get fixed in a few months, but hey, at least the aesthetics look great?

1222670,2024-09-12,"As a long-time fan of The Sims franchise, I have mixed feelings about The Sims 4. On its own, the game is undeniably fun, with improved graphics and smoother gameplay compared to its predecessors. It shines in areas like character customization and building mechanics, offering players endless possibilities to create and shape their Sims' world. If you're looking for a casual, life-simulation experience, Sims 4 delivers, but it comes with a serious caveat.  The real issue is the aggressive monetization strategy. The sheer amount of DLC content that feels like it should have been part of the base game is, quite frankly, ridiculous. Key features that many players loved in Sims 3, such as university life, pets, seasons, and even simple tasks like laundry, are all locked behind paywalls. To get the ""complete"" experience, you're looking at spending hundreds of dollars, which feels like a cash grab from the developers. It makes me long for the days of Sims 3 when the base game was robust, and DLCs felt more like fun add-ons rather than essential expansions.  For those who don't want to fork out the extra cash, mods are a great alternative. The Sims 4 modding community is incredibly talented and dedicated, often releasing content that rivals or even surpasses the official DLCs. With mods, you can enjoy much of what the DLC offers without breaking the bank, though it does require some trial and error to avoid game-breaking issues.  Overall, I do recommend Sims 4 because it's a solid life simulation game and has some genuinely enjoyable moments. But be warned—without DLC or mods, the experience can feel limited. The game desperately needs a competitor to shake up the market, because while Sims 4 can be fun, it also feels like it's gouging its players at every turn.  Verdict: 7/10—Great base, but you need mods or DLC to unlock its full potential.",139.5,Recommended,64,long time fan sims franchise mix feeling sims game undeniably fun improved graphic smooth gameplay compare predecessor shin area like character customization building mechanic offer player endless possibility create shape sims world look casual life simulation experience sims delivers come serious caveat real issue aggressive monetization strategy sheer amount dlc content feel like part base game quite frankly ridiculous key feature many player love sims university life pet season even simple task like laundry lock behind paywalls get complete experience look spend hundred dollar feel like cash grab developer make long day sims base game robust dlc felt like fun add ons rather essential dlc want fork extra cash mods great alternative sims mod community incredibly talented dedicate often release content rival even surpass official dlc mods enjoy much dlc offer without break bank though require trial error avoid game break issue overall recommend sims solid life simulation game genuinely enjoyable moment warn without dlc mods experience feel limit game desperately need competitor shake market sims fun also feel like gouge player every turn verdict great base need mods dlc unlock full potential

1222670,2022-10-16,"It was a Tuesday, I had returned from a thankless and pointless days work unusually to be greeted by my child's beaming face full of excitement.  I managed to maintain eye contact long enough for her to inform me that she required a new game, evidently as she demonstrated purely on the recommendation of some generic man child YouTubers obnoxious Sims 4 reaction videos.  I tried to explain to her that I did not think it was age appropriate and that it would not hold her attention for long, but she firmly insisted and when I suddenly noticed my wife's stern disapproving look rapidly forming I immediately demurred and agreed post haste to purchase with the quick proviso that this would not include any of the DLC's as they cost more then Daddy makes in a month at work.  The feeling of euphoria that overwhelmed me when I saw the game was on sale is almost indescribable, my whole body was pulsating and flowing with loving tingly energy for my beautiful lord Gaben, I allowed myself to close my eyes for just a moment to witness his magnificent cherubim form majestically aloft amongst the clouds in heaven.  After making a brief 15 min power point presentation on the importance of the nuclear family for western prosperity and society and the value and superiority of the capitalist system I felt secure that my 6 year old daughter was firmly mentally prepared to begin playing Sims 4.  As she went through the initial creation of her first Sim there was a moment of confusion when I had to explain to her without fully appreciating the ramifications that she needed to make a young adult version of herself as her avatar as children would have no agency or capability for self reliance.  After a modest starter home had been procured and a reasonable starting allowance for furnishings and sundries had been provided I sat back satisfied at a job well done and full of anticipation to witness my daughters fledgling first steps into the real world.  I was sure my loving care and guidance would help form her and her Sim into the very model of a productive member of society.  Daddy how do I get money for things she immediately asked, you need to get a job I excitedly answered as I encouraged her to peruse the job market and start sending applications.  The first alarm bells were going off, she was hesitating to seek gainful employment, I explained you wont be able to buy the things you want unless you get a job to earn money.  I eagerly awaited the moment my daughter would understand the reality of the situation, but she replied no daddy I can marry someone who pays for everything like mommy, when I explained that not everyone is as generous as daddy she replied then I can sell these things in my house to get money.  She then proceeded to rapidly sell the bed, toilet and kitchen everything all gone the house was completely empty only to enable her to immediately fill it with thoroughly impractical pointless frivolous nonsense.  After she became frustrated that her Sim quickly became tired, hungry, dirty and emotionally distraught I pointed out that she now had no way to eat, sleep, wash or even leave the house as all the doors and windows had been sold.  After thinking for a moment she then informed me that she did not need any of that as she could go to live in other peoples houses and use their bathrooms, kitchens and beds and if she needed money she could take things from their houses.  I began to panic and I could see Sims 4 was morally corrupting my daughter and undoing years of careful parenting in only a few moments, after her Sim was thrown out of all her neighbours houses for trespassing and free loading my daughter decided she wanted to be a mother.  Yes I thought this could be the solution, after my daughter has the burden of a child she will surely change her ways to become more responsible, after a few minutes she had created her child, a small toddler she gleefully named Poo Boy.  After me witnessing 30 mins of child abuse by my daughter that poor little boy was taken away, Im truly sorry Poo Boy I hope you find a better home with the loving parents you deserve.  My daughter now rapidly losing interest in the game declared she wanted a pet specifically a cat, when I looked at the price of the single Sims 4 Cats & Dogs DLC my rage with almost unbridled, I wanted to scream at the unholy injustice but barely managed to maintain the semblance of sanity, my left eye twitching uncontrollably through gritted teeth I asked my daughter to solemnly agree this would be the only DLC she would ask for.  When she promised me it would be I frantically justified the outrageous price to my self, if this was the price of happiness for my daughter it was a cross I was willing to bare just this once, damn you EA, damn you to hell.  After 5 mins my daughter was bored of her new cat.  My child's needy demanding voice was like knives piercing deep into my soul, daddy I want to be a vampire and go on holiday and get married and be famous, could she really be my progeny I wondered how could she of betrayed me like this.  NO ! I bellowed in her tiny face as loud as my soyboy beta lungs could muster No more DLC's you promised me I said, my daughters face erupted in tears and screams of anguish.  My wife was upon me like a wild animal her face furious with the thermonuclear potential of a thousand suns seething in her eyes her utter contempt for my very existence plainly evident, You will get her what she wants she screamed inch's from my face.  Immediately and humiliatingly all my resistance deflated like a wet paper bag , realising I was completely and utterly in the wrong to meekly without hesitation agree to purchase every DLC my daughter desired.  Whilst clicking add all DLC to cart and noticing the combined cost of 57 DLC's was just shy of $1000 I barely felt the last shred of dignity and last hope of masculinity slip away from me forever to be lost like my soul.  Thank you EA for irrevocably damaging my daughter morally, bankrupting me and ending my marriage.  Looking back on it all now at least I can be thankful that after we lost the house and my wife and daughter are gone forever, I can still take some solace in vicariously always now having a perfect life in Sims 4 thanks to all those wonderful DLC's that improved my life immeasurably which in a way is almost consolation enough.",12.9,Recommended,299,tuesday return thankless pointless day work unusually greet child beam face full excitement manage maintain eye contact long enough inform require new game evidently demonstrate purely recommendation generic man child youtubers obnoxious sims reaction video try explain think age appropriate hold attention long firmly insist suddenly notice wife stern disapprove look rapidly form immediately demur agree post haste purchase quick proviso include dlc cost daddy make month work feeling euphoria overwhelm saw game sale almost indescribable whole body pulsate flow love tingly energy beautiful lord gaben allow close eye moment witness magnificent cherub form majestically aloft amongst cloud heaven make brief min power point presentation importance nuclear family western prosperity society value superiority capitalist system felt secure year old daughter firmly mentally prepared begin play sims go initial creation first sims moment confusion explain without fully appreciate ramification need make young adult version avatar child agency capability self reliance modest starter home procure reasonable starting allowance furnishing sundries provide sit back satisfy job well do full anticipation witness daughter fledgling first step real world sure loving care guidance help form sims model productive member society daddy get money thing immediately ask need get job excitedly answer encourage peruse job market start send application first alarm bell go hesitate seek gainful employment explain wont able buy thing want unless get job earn money eagerly await moment daughter understand reality situation reply daddy marry someone pay everything like mommy explain everyone generous daddy reply sell thing house get money proceed rapidly sell bed toilet kitchen everything go house completely empty enable immediately fill thoroughly impractical pointless frivolous nonsense become frustrated sims quickly become tired hungry dirty emotionally distraught point way eat sleep wash even leave house door window sell think moment inform need go livemode people house use bathroom kitchen bed need money take thing house begin panic see sims morally corrupt daughter undoing year careful parenting moment sims throw neighbour house trespass free load daughter decide want mother yes think solution daughter burden child surely change way become responsible minute create child small toddler gleefully name poo boy witness min child abuse daughter poor little boy take away im truly sorry poo boy hope find good home love parent deserve daughter rapidly lose interest game declare want pet specifically cat look price single sims cat dog dlc rage almost unbridled want scream unholy injustice barely manage maintain semblance sanity left eye twitching uncontrollably grit teeth ask daughter solemnly agree dlc ask promise frantically justify outrageous price self price happiness daughter cross willing bare damn ea damn hell min daughter bore new cat child needy demand voice like knife pierce deep soul daddy want vampire go holiday get marry famous really progeny wonder betrayed like bellow tiny face loud soyboy beta lung muster dlc promise say daughter face erupt tear scream anguish wife upon like wild animal face furious thermonuclear potential thousand sun seethe eye utter contempt existence plainly evident get want scream inch face immediately humiliatingly resistance deflate like wet paper bag realise completely utterly wrong meekly without hesitation agree purchase every dlc daughter desire whilst click add dlc cart notice combined cost dlc shy barely felt last shred dignity last hope masculinity slip away forever lose like soul thank ea irrevocably damage daughter morally bankrupt end marriage look back least thankful lose house wife daughter go forever still take solace vicariously always perfect life sims thanks wonderful dlc improve life immeasurably way almost consolation enough

From designing unique characters with distinct personalities and appearances to building and customizing dream homes, the game provides an expansive canvas for creativity.  Endless Gameplay: The sheer number of expansion packs, stuff packs, and mods available for The Sims ensures that the game never gets stale. Whether you want to explore different careers, engage in romantic relationships, or simply enjoy the daily lives of your Sims, there's always something new to discover.  Accessible to All Ages: The Sims is a family-friendly game that appeals to a wide audience. Its easy-to-learn mechanics make it accessible to younger players, while its depth and complexity offer a rewarding experience for adults.  Engaging Social Dynamics: Watching your Sims interact with each other and the world around them is both humorous and engaging. The social dynamics and quirky behaviors of your virtual citizens can lead to surprising and entertaining situations.  Cons:  Expensive with Expansions: While the base game of The Sims 4 is free, the cost of expansion packs can add up quickly. Some players may find it challenging to keep up with all the additional content.  Limited Realism: The Sims is a life simulator with a lighthearted and often whimsical tone. While it captures many aspects of everyday life, it's not a true-to-life simulation, which may disappoint those seeking a more realistic experience.  Performance Issues: Depending on your computer's hardware, The Sims can occasionally suffer from performance issues, particularly when running the game with numerous expansion packs or mods.  In summary, The Sims 4 is a delightful and enduring life simulation game that offers an unparalleled level of creativity and entertainment.

1222670,2022-08-02,"As is typical for EA, you pay quite a lot for a game filled to the brim with bugs and glitches.  It takes weeks or months for them to iron out the problems with one expansion pack (which you pay for separately) or an update, and by the time that's resolved, they're releasing something else that breaks the game.  The game is playable without mods, but for any reasonable level of functionality, and certainly to make it enjoyable to play for any period of time, CC and mods are what make the game worthwhile. But EA treats the content creators very poorly, despite the hours of unpaid labor they're pouring into the game to make it a good experience for players, and every update breaks most of the mods.  So every time there's an update, you have to decide whether to wade through all the bugs and hope there's nothing that erases your legacy saves (as happened to many people in the last update) or to just not play for an undetermined period of time until most of it is fixed and the bugs go back to being quirky instead of game-ending.  At the moment, I decided to stop playing my regular saves, due to the dangerous, game-breaking bugs, and to create a new character. Unfortunately, I was unable to get out of CAS without restarting several times, and now I can't even save the hours of work I put into creating the Sim.  So, my recommendation is to not even get started with the game, and you won't feel any disappointment from the sunk-investment fallacy.",990.1,Not Recommended,113,typical ea pay quite lot game fill brim bug glitch take week month iron problem one dlc dlc pay separately update time resolve release something else break game game playable without mods reasonable level functionality certainly make enjoyable play period time cc mods make game worthwhile ea treat content creator poorly despite hour unpaid labor pour game make good experience player every update break mods every time update decide whether wade bug hope nothing erase legacy save happen many people last update play undetermined period time fix bug go back quirky instead game end moment decide stop play regular save due dangerous game break bug create new character unfortunately unable get cas without restart several time even save hour work put create sims recommendation even get start game feel disappointment sunk investment fallacy

1222670,2022-12-10,"As someone who has spent so much of my gaming life in the world of simulation games—my absolute favorite genre—I just can’t quite bring myself to fully embrace The Sims 4 the way I do with its earlier versions. While it has definitely achieved commercial success, there are a few things that have left a bit of a bittersweet feeling among its loyal fanbase. It all started with the absence of babies, pools, and ghosts, which caused a lot of concern, and unfortunately, more issues surfaced that didn’t sit well with me.  One thing that really stood out was the price increase for the base game and various expansion packs, stuff packs, and game packs—especially after the release of Cats & Dogs. I know a lot of players, myself included, were disappointed by this, as it made it even harder for many to keep up with the game's growing content.  On a more emotional note, one of the more touching aspects of The Sims 4 is its focus on emotions. It was the first time we really got to see our Sims experience complex feelings like anger, frustration, and even boredom, reacting in ways that felt so real. While emotions were a huge selling point, I think we all hoped they would make a deeper impact on how the game unfolds. In truth, though, they don’t change things quite as much as we expected.  Still, emotions are at the heart of The Sims 4, and it’s important to understand how they work. They’re very much like the mood modifiers we’ve seen in the past, but with the added twist that certain events, people, and even objects can influence a Sim's feelings. What’s even more interesting is that emotions can evolve, from feeling embarrassed to being mortified—how sweetly dramatic, right?  One thing that’s been hard for many fans, including myself, is how fragmented the content feels in The Sims 4. It seems like EA has intentionally split some items and gameplay into different expansions or packs, and that’s been a little tough to swallow. A perfect example was the My First Pet object pack, which introduced cute little hamsters and other small animals. Fans were upset because it came out after the Cats & Dogs expansion, and it honestly could’ve been included there instead of being sold separately.  There’s no denying that The Sims 4 has its flaws, but for those of us who adore the franchise and the magic of simulation games, it still has a special place in our hearts. The graphics are stunning, and the expansions—though few and far between—do add some lovely elements to the game.",110.0,Recommended,65,someone spend much game life world simulation game absolute favorite genre quite bring fully embrace sims way early version definitely achieve commercial success thing leave bit bittersweet feeling among loyal fanbase start absence baby pool ghost cause lot concern unfortunately issue surface sit well one thing really stand price increase base game various dlc dlc stuff dlc game dlc especially release cat dog know lot player include disappoint make even hard many keep game grow content emotional note one touching aspect sims focus emotion first time really get see sims experience complex feeling like anger frustration even boredom react way felt real emotion huge selling point think hop make deep impact game unfold truth though change thing quite much expect still emotion heart sims important understand work much like mood modifier see past added twist certain event people even object influence sims feeling even interesting emotion evolve feel embarrass mortify sweetly dramatic right one thing hard many fan include fragmented content feel sims seem like ea intentionally split item gameplay different dlc dlc little tough swallow perfect example first pet object dlc introduce cute little hamster small animal fan upset come cat dog dlc honestly include instead sell separately denying sims flaw adore franchise magic simulation game still special place heart graphic stun dlc though far add lovely element game

1222670,2020-06-22,"TL;DR: Game is ok base game wise and has it's own strengths and weaknesses, DLC definitely improves it though. Price is definitely terrible for DLC, so wait for sales. Base Game 7/10, Game with the 4 mentioned DLC 9/10  This game WITHOUT DLC is... meh. It's definitely shallow in comparison to Sims 3, and it's missing several features that seem vacant for no reason at all. An open world being one of these removed features. The moodlet system is really nice and it changes up how the game is played overall as now you ACTUALLY have to play while keeping your sim's emotions in mind. The relationships between sims are a bit more dynamic it seems, and skills that were once unnecessary are now key to making certain things go as planned like pick-up lines and jokes requiring charisma and the new comedy skill. More dynamic job systems are definitely welcome. Some side gigs like writing and such have been reworked and even overhauled in some ways to be ultimately better. Creating a Sim is more dynamic as far as body goes, but the clothing options are severely hampered due to the inability to make custom clothing or even hair colors. The hair color options are slim, so removing the ability to have custom hair colors seems like a bad move in my opinion. The AI of sims have somehow both gotten better and worse. Sims will actually actively take care of themselves better based on what I've seen, but they also make nonsensical choices for seemingly no reason at all. For example, When instructing my sim to go indoors he picks the longest way to get there sometimes. Also, sometimes sims will have conversations while making food and even though there's an open spot at the table they will actively go to the sofa in the other room, thus ending the conversation abruptly. Aside from these gripes, I think the base game is pretty alright. Also, there are no substantial community hangouts on the map at all in the base game, only parks which is strange. The game itself is just plots to build a house and put sims in as random sims come and go from your house. That effectively brought this game down from a good game to an underwhelming meh game immediately. This means the only plot worth visiting is your own house, then you just hope that sims that have time to talk to you show up. They later added more in DLC, but this segment is for the base game. Ultimately it had me on the fence the whole time. Certainly wait till the base game goes on sale for super cheap.  Once you add DLC though, this game ends up becoming great. For this segment, I have particularly gotten Get to Work, Get Famous, Get Together, and Seasons. I think these 4 are the quintessential DLC's that you must get when you can. These expansions add what the game is missing like the aforementioned local hangout spots (which are added in Get Together). The content the expansions add are definitely something worth noting. Get to Work and Get Together are the ones (in my opinon) you ought to go for first. They add what the game needed for sure, such as more interactive jobs and social hang out locations. The other two I listed add stuff like a fame system that actually works better than the one in sims 3 and seasons with more holidays than the sims 3 by a landslide (you can even make your own holidays). HOWEVER there is one glaring problem with all of the DLC's... the price tag. These DLC's have no business being priced as much as the game itself. None. So my advice, just like the base game, WAIT FOR A SALE. There's even DLC for DLC, its kind of absurd (Looking at the ""My first pet stuff pack""). Aside from pricing though, these DLC's are actually solid and even adds stuff that sims 3 didn't have/handled poorly.",97.5,Recommended,51,tl dr game ok base game wise strength weakness dlc definitely improve though price definitely terrible dlc wait sale base game game mention dlc game without dlc meh definitely shallow comparison sims miss several feature seem vacant reason open world one remove feature moodlet system really nice change game play overall actually play keep sims emotion mind relationship sims bit dynamic seem skill unnecessary key make certain thing go plan like pick line joke require charisma new comedy skill dynamic job system definitely welcome side gig like write rework even overhaul way ultimately well create sims dynamic far body go clothing option severely hamper due inability make custom clothing even hair color hair color option slim remove ability custom hair color seem like bad move opinion ai sims somehow get good bad sims actually actively take care good base see also make nonsensical choice seemingly reason example instruct sims go indoors pick long way get sometimes also sometimes sims conversation make food even though open spot table actively go sofa room thus end conversation abruptly aside gripe think base game pretty alright also substantial community hangout map base game park strange game plot buildmode house put sims random sims come go house effectively bring game good game underwhelming meh game immediately mean plot worth visit house hope sims time talk show later add dlc segment base game ultimately fence whole time certainly wait till base game go sale super cheap add dlc though game end become great segment particularly get get work get famous get together season think quintessential dlc must get dlc add game miss like aforementioned local hangout spot add get together content dlc add definitely something worth note get work get together one opinon ought go first add game need sure interactive job social hang location two list add stuff like fame system actually work well one sims season holiday sims landslide even make holiday however one glaring problem dlc price tag dlc business price much game none advice like base game wait sale even dlc dlc kind absurd look first pet stuff dlc aside price though dlc actually solid even add stuff sims handle poorly

1222670,2020-09-02,"It's been difficult for me to express the joy this game has brought me. My brother played a couple of the first ones way back in the day and the idea of micro managing toiletries and doing household chores never appealed to me. I watched a let's play of a team of people seeing who can kill their sims the quickest, and while I never really plan to be that cruel, it still gave me a good look at the interface and it was the first time I thought ""hey that actually looks kind of fun"". Sure enough, I would go on to dump almost 90 hours on it within a week (my back going out and having to stay home from work helped this endeavor).  It's still hard for me to explain why I love it so much. In one way, it caters to my inner character creation. My mind has always been a character generator and I've blogged and done short stories about my various characters throughout the years. This game allows me to get into their heads a bit more and live their daily lives. I have a powerful witch, a naturalist islander, a famous painter and DJ, a couple of adorable aliens... And one character whom is essentially my self-insert, a woman I wish I could be. She's a writer, and made a surprisingly decent living dumping out blog posts, reviews, and a children's book about my childhood teddy bear. If only it were all this easy in real life.  That really is the appeal, isn't it? I never thought of Sims as a 'lifestyle simulator', but here we are.  I wish I could go review each and every pack but I got a good chunk of them on sale through Humble Bundle, but it went directly to Origin so I can't directly review some of them. I will say that if you're reading this and wondering; Seasons and Magic are probably my top two favorite. Season adds weekly dynamic events that really help shuffle up your daily routine and get you out into the world properly. Strangerville adds a more point-and-click adventure style type game but Act 3 brought in an irritating mechanic that forced me to rush through it. I could go on all day about the packs but I'll save that for my actual blog.  I'll do a short dive into the gameplay. As you might be aware you can create a sim or multiple, I believe the max is eight? I had trouble just managing four so most of my households stop at 3 and maybe a pet or two. You can indeed manage their daily toiletries but I honestly cheat in some reward store perks that shut down the needs to eat and sleep and that has paid dividends into making the gameplay more enjoyable for me personally. Regardless, I've done non-cheaty characters in solo or duo households and it can be managed once you get some of the basics down. My aforementioned writer made a small living off of publishing her books and thus lacked a proper job for a while, which in turn gave me a lot more time to manage her usual bodily functions.  I will admit I don't build any damn thing from scratch but thankfully there is an online, in-game gallery where you can sift through some of your favorite creations and just plop them instantly, funds allowing. The most I do is combine and slap together premade rooms and then just work on the decor and upgrade. I never build anything myself because I just do not have the mind of an interior decorator.  One quick point of contention: Loading up the gallery destroys my bandwidth. It freezes most of my computer's functions as it's loading. It hasn't caused any crashes, but my podcasts and youtube videos start having hiccups, like an old skipping CD and it's very annoying.  Beyond that, everything else is a nitpick. You can go on all day about EA's general business practices. Some of the packs can be seen as simple cash grabs, and the upcoming Star Wars pack looks fun but I think it breaks the flow of the game somewhat.  All the same, I've adored this game and will be playing it for several weeks to come. Or at least until Cyberpunk 2077 comes out. I have more to say but as I mentioned, I'll save it for my blog.",386.2,Recommended,47,difficult express joy game bring brother play couple first one way back day idea micro manage toiletry household chore never appeal watch let play team people see kill sims quick never really plan cruel still give good look interface first time think hey actually look kind fun sure enough go dump almost hour within week back go stay home work help endeavor still hard explain love much one way cater inner character creation mind always character generator blogged do short story various character throughout year game allow get head bit livemode daily life powerful witch naturalist islander famous painter dj couple adorable alien one character essentially self insert woman wish writer make surprisingly decent living dump blog post review child book childhood teddy bear easy real life really appeal never think sims lifestyle simulator wish go review every dlc get good chunk sale humble bundle go directly origin directly review say read wonder season magic probably top two favorite season add weekly dynamic event really help shuffle daily routine get world properly strangerville add point click adventure style type game act brought irritating mechanic force rush go day dlc save actual blog short dive gameplay might aware create sims multiple believe max eight trouble manage four household stop maybe pet two indeed manage daily toiletry honestly cheat reward store perk shut need eat sleep pay dividend make gameplay enjoyable personally regardless do non cheaty character solo duo household manage get basic aforementioned writer make small living publish book thus lack proper job turn give lot time manage usual bodily function admit buildmode damn thing scratch thankfully online game gallery sift favorite creation plop instantly fund allow combine slap together premade room work decor upgrade never buildmode anything mind interior decorator one quick point contention load gallery destroy bandwidth freeze computer function load cause crash podcasts youtube videos start hiccup like old skipping cd annoy beyond everything else nitpick go day ea general business practice dlc see simple cash grab upcoming star war dlc look fun think break flow game somewhat adore game play several week come least cyberpunk come say mention save blog

1222670,2023-12-03,"Oh The Sims 4, how I longed to leave a review of this before. But oh what a surprise, you can't leave reviews on the EA/Origin app. I wonder why that is.  After what seems like 100 years of them pushing this unfinished and unwanted piece of trash on us, the game is still riddled with bugs, poorly optimized, badly coded, and devoid of basic features. I would not recommend this game on my worst enemy.  In Sims 4, there is a severe lack of gameplay and they stripped out half the features of the Sims 3 base game. Which in itself was a great game, lacking only in technical performance aspects and a severely aggressive micro-transaction model, and a few minor gameplay features from the previous Sims games before it. Then we arrive to Sims 4, with no more open world, now you are limited to EAs poor selection of cookie-cutter worlds devoid of life and fun places to go. You can only add a handful of buildings and 4 or 5 houses in an entire city. And then when you go to a location, random people spawn but the game can't handle more than a few, so you end up on large empty lots with nobody around.  It makes no sense that a 2011 game of Skyrim which has been released on ever platform imaginable can spawn hundreds of NPCs with routines into a city and they can go about their day but EA can't manage to program a game years later that runs with a simple variable to track how much someone has to go pee pee? It is pure ineptitude and incompetence on the part of EA and their developers, or complete and brazen leadership that has no vision and no concern for the fans or the game genre.  Generally, when you buy the base version of a game, and they come out with a sequel, they integrate some or most of the previous game DLC into the new one - not EA. They charge you for every single feature all over again in the form of expansion packs and stuff packs. And half of the expansion packs lack concepts and items that were in that same expansion pack for the previous game. Though EA remains committed to pushing packs out their a**, it's clear they have no intention of fixing the obvious problems in this game, and have not learned a single lesson from the obvious failures of this game to put towards Sims 5 going forward.  You may see that my playtime increases in this game and question that against this review. This is because it is simply the only iteration available for this genre for which to scratch a certain gaming itch. The Sims 1 and 2, while great games, and Sims 3 as well, are plagued with issues on modern hardware. Sims 4 is the only version that works to some degree. There are some mods you can install to add some gameplay features, but the game never holds your attention for long. I find myself creating people and buildings and then getting ready to play, playing for a while, and getting bored and not playing for months. Then when I come back, all my work is gone due to game updates or the s*** EA/Origin launcher that I have to redo making all my Sims again, and repeat ad nauseam.  On the horizon, are finally a bunch of competitors to this game. I anticipate that just like Cities Skylines killed EA's SimCity, and how Planet Coaster killed EA'S Roller Coaster Tycoon, the same will happen to the Sims with one of these new games that will wipe this off the face of the earth due to EA's lack of attention to fans outcries, and malicious monetization of the franchise, and failure to innovate or provide any care for gamers or respect for the series as a whole.

1222670,2021-04-06,"So far I have over 1010 hours for Sims 4 on Origin. The hour counter started all over when I came to Steam to play and had to re-download the game to Steam (this was the only issue that annoyed me) but I'm sure I'll be up to thousands of hours on Steam too. Add all that to the hours that I have played The Sims 4 or other Sims games in the past since I was 17 and that is a lot of playtime! Off and on, over 20 years of play. Honestly most people prefer the Sims 3 because of attention to detail and more complicated personalities.. but Sims 4 has it's own charms. Personally my old SIMS favorite was The URBZ (Sims in the City)! Id LOVE to play that game again! It gave you a direct path and set achievements as well as some big personalities.  So.... welcome to the SIMS if you are new! This game is pretty hard to explain. Its what you make of it. The SIMS is like real life, all the things that happen depend on your characters choices. That the base game itself stands alone well and you don't need to get the packs and extensions. If you do get them however, most of them will create a new way to play and sometimes a new town or a new world. So honestly, to me that is kind of like a new game. I enjoy getting the packs, but they do usually cost the price of a new game. There are also smaller packs and add ons that are pretty fun too. Again, the packs aren't needed though. The game is unique and interesting by itself.  You will never find another game where the characters come to life like this. Games typically center around a goal that your character must accomplish. The environment, people around them and the reactions of your character are written out already and pre-planned. You are watching the game play out the way that it will play out for millions of other players. The SIMS however never plays out the same way. Even when players try the same Sims challenges the turn out will be different and the interplay and things that happen will be random and totally different. The SIMS characters have minds of their own (like AI), their own feelings and their own changeable and achievable dreams. * * *That is what I love the most about the SIMS* * *. The psychology and realism of play when it comes to personalities, emotions, psychology, relationships and life events is wonderful. It is the whole reason I play. Avatars and characters in other games just do not have the random emotions or random decisions like the characters in the Sims. Each time you open the game there are so many random things that can happen. Your own SIM character will have its own mind and so will every SIM in the game that interacts with your Sim. The interplay between characters is what gets interesting. Just be sure to learn to take care of their needs and balance fun with work and life with dreams and their life should end up entertaining (and funny). As your character ages they will change and grow and develop skills, traits, abilities, favorites and more.... they will most likely have spouses, children and even grand-children and each of them will be different as well. Your SIMS can have pets too (and new to the game are farms!). And once they retire and age and eventually die you can switch your mindset to guiding the lives of their kids and grand-kids... it all goes on forever.  The life of your sim is a little world of its own with no specified goal just like real life. You are not made to do anything but exist, eat, sleep, wash, go to the bathroom, and have a bit of fun. Everything else about their life or goals or destiny is just dreamt up by the player. Your character can dream of any kind of life and each kind of life is a new game in itself. One SIM could want to be homeless and living in a tent from town to town, another could become the most famous actor ever. Your character can be a hardworking you-tuber or a scientist who gets abducted by aliens. Be a detective and solve crimes or be a veterinarian. You can now even be a Jedi or work for the empire. You can have a cottage with a little farm or be an interior designer. You can work with the paranormal and catch ghosts or just raise a family.  There is so much open to you that you are creating your own game. You can also farm in your garden, make money from knitting or just be a mommy with tons of babies. You can own a dog, cat or even animals like leopards.  The CC (custom content) that players create is all downloadable for free on safe websites and is also accepted and encouraged for use in the game so that opens up hundreds of opportunities as well.  If you are creative at all you wont be able to stop dreaming in this game. There is always something new to do. The cannon characters are great as well. Each character from the game creator will be complicated, different from any others and surprising. All the characters are lgbtq friendly as well. THE SIMS had lgbtq characters back before anyone else. You can add to your cannon SIMS town by making your own new neighbors for your town and replacing all the original neighbors with characters you custom make, or you can stick with the old favorites. My favorite cannon family is the Goth family (who since the first game were the Adams family of the Sims). Sure their house in SIMS 4 isnt as spooky as it becomes later in their cannon story (sims 1 and sims 2 are later in the timeline), but you can make it as spooky as you like once you play since you can edit all the land, houses and characters in town. Bella Goth is my favorite SIM and has always been kinda why I play.. great personality, spoOOoky oOOoooky family.  Enjoy this game. Make it whatever you want. Also... if you become a fan and start wanting to play the older games you will never be disappointed. Each SIMS game is packed with so much to make it unique from the others. Sims 3 still stands up to SIMS 4 and still competes with it in many ways. If you try it you'll see why.  Anyway, I hope this helps someone! (Oh did I mention that every word in their language is really translatable? ""Dag Dag!"")  PS never play the phone Sims. Its nothing at all like the actual game. Play here, play the full game with the crazy personalities everywhere....the phone games are okay but they dont have the same AI type SIMS, the Sims on phone games have very little personality.  So to everyone the SIMS are worth a try, but you've got to know what the game is about first.. be creative and open your mind. You'll also need the cheat codes (allowed by the creators and encouraged), maybe a little of the mods (also encouraged) a few packs for spicing it up.. and an idea of what you want to create.

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.  Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.  Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.  Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.  Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

BTW Origin won't allow you to take the game to Steam only Steam to Origin. To top the cake you gotta pay around $700 for all the dlc. SIMS 3 HAD MORE CONTENT IN THE BASE GAME THEN THIS GAME COULD EVERY WISH FOR, sadly, EA IS JUST MILKING PEOPLE WITH SIMS 4. Overall the only thing I like about the game is the clean looking graphics and small things they have only recently fixed... like stairs but, not worth the cash~money and extra spending just to have DLCs I've got with sims 3 for a better price. PS most dlc barely has anything, mod creators offer more if you really want to get the game. -WARNING- Do research on the dlcs if you purchase!

1222670,2024-10-11,"Long have I lingered within the realm of this game, spending more hours than I care to admit. Yet in truth, it has been a lifeline for me, a beacon of solace during the dark days of quarantine, when no companions could be found, and the weight of sorrow pressed heavily upon me. I recall the days I shared this world with my cousin, though it was but three years ago when I finally claimed the game for my own (back when coin was still required to enter its gates). Since then, it has brought me much joy and distraction.  Yet, I must confess, to truly revel in the experience, I sought out custom content and mods to breathe new life into the world. That, perhaps, is the beauty of *The Sims 4*—its very essence is shaped by your hand, and the journey is as rich as you make it. There are many who craft wonders to enrich the base game with CC and mods, though, alas, the need for a few additional packs cannot be denied, for the base game is, by itself, quite meager. Indeed, its limitations can be quite stark.  My hope is that EA shall continue to breathe new life into this game that has stood beside me in troubled times. I cherish the joy of creating characters, the vast freedom of customization, and the wondrous building system. Yet, the gameplay itself can grow weary, especially for those who possess only the base game. :]  Thank you for reading!

And each DLC that provides minimum content (that were provided in the base game itself for previous Sims titles) is priced ridiculously high. The whole game is set up to be a cash grab.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It drains your money (on DLCs, since the game is only really enjoyable with mods/DLCs and boy are they overpriced), makes you tired (from staying up late playing it), takes up way too much of your time, destroys your sanity, and generally makes your life a living hell. It's also impossible to quit. You can't get enough of it (that's how they trick you into buying the DLCs), and even if you stop playing, you will be back in a few months. If you're an experienced player, it's even harder to quit. The entire community loathes this game and are an extremely dedicated fanbase.  This game is going to ruin my life and I hate it. It's also my favorite game and I will never quit it. It's the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I'm so happy I downloaded it. Would not recommend this game to anyone.

I put 1000+ hrs into it on Origin (Don't judge me I wasn't invited to parties in HS) This game saved my life during a time where I almost gave up on life. Watching simmers videos on YouTube made me realize that The Sims is a stress relieving game for those that hate what's currently going on in the world or hate how their life is going this is a great escape from all of it. I do have a few problems with it. There's no cloud saves on either version of the game, the cloud saves are only on consoles that's my main complaint. I love The Sims series a lot and I do find the expansions worth it (only when their on sale) Humble Bundle is currently doing a sale on the game and every piece of DLC (Origin versions Only) the good thing about it however is that you can use all of those DLC with the Steam version once your link your Origin account to your Steam account. I love the fact that EA is putting their origin games on Steam (even though you'll still need Origin for some weird reason) however it does open door for millions of Steam users to play these games especially multiplayer games where some FPS games are usually dead in a year due to lack of player (CoD on Steam).",28.4,Recommended,31,finally sims hit steam year playing get sims since finally much well platform play put hr origin judge invite party h game save life time almost give life watch simmer videos youtube make realize sims stress relieve game hate currently go world hate life go great escape problem cloud save either version game cloud save console main complaint love sims series lot find dlc worth sale humble bundle currently sale game every piece dlc origin version good thing however use dlc steam version link origin account steam account love fact ea put origin game steam even though still need origin weird reason however open door million steam user play game especially multiplayer game fps game usually dead year due lack player cod steam

A good example for this is the StrangerVille pack this just feels like a spin off game idea something akin to The Sims Medieval or The Sims Castaway. Also any other life state apart from young adult and adult don't have any if some game play at all 7 years later... The sims went from a life sim to a millennial sim, sad to say buts its true.

1222670,2020-07-14,"The Sims 4 is the most lacking base game we got and took awhile just to get pools, ghosts, stairs that can bend and now windows that can be put on half tiles. The things they did get right this game? Create a Sim is WAY EASIER to make unique looking sims and not have them all looking like the same in game. Building is amazing in this game, it’s a lot more friendly then Sims 3 ever was because it doesn’t punish you for changing the floorplan or wanting to add a basement like the sims 3 did. That being said the sims lack that personality they had in the past games and they all start to feel the same after a generation. If you want to play base game only for a while I would say you need mods because that’s the only way you fix the dull gameplay it has to offer.  Mods I would use? MC Command Center , Slice of Life, UI Cheats, Meaningful Stories, Basemental Drugs (18+), Wicked Whims (18+) and T.O.O.L if you like to build.  The DLC is way too much for what they have to offer but that being said you don’t have to buy the DLC on steam. If you shop around on CD key sites and activate the code on origin, you can still use the DLC well playing the steam version. Which means another thing people hate, It launches Origin to play the game which is a turn off for most people.  I would still say buy it, I picked up some DLC and i’m having a blast playing.

Look at it this way, for 39.99 you can get BlazBlue Centralfiction, one of the best fighting games on the market, a game with 36 characters all of which are well-designed and fun to play, or you could get the ability to go to University in the Sims, a classic expansion for the series but one which pales in comparison to it's predecessor in the Sims 3.  I would add that you have to buy the base game too, but after 6 years of being sold for around $20, it's finally going Free to Play, presumably because the executives at EA figure that they won't be getting any new players if they still have to pay to start the game. The game without DLC feels hollow and empty, like parts of the game were deliberately stripped away to be sold back as DLC later.  The DLC is a very hard sell, to bring it back to the BlazBlue comparison, Centralfiction has one DLC, priced at 7.99 Jubei is an entire character with new mechanics, combos, and a new playstyle. EA seems to think that for 9.99 you deserve hot tubs. hot tubs. That's it, that's their 10 dollar DLC. In total the DLC contains 32 housing items, only 2 of which (the hot tubs) are functionally different than other items. It's other additions are 3 hairstyles and 9 clothing items. Obviously I don't expect for these two games to have comparable since a lot of the sims is building houses and customization, but I think these features are worth 2.99 AT BEST. It is embarrassing that EA has the nerve to charge us $10 for this. It is a bad deal, plain and simple.  The game is fun, it's very well made for the most part, and I even think a some of the DLC is very good. I cannot recommend it in good concise though.

1222670,2023-04-29,"I think people have said it: to “actually play and enjoy the game to the fullest, you have to pay over $10,000 for paywall packs.""  (Edit) Okay, I wrote this review a long time ago with limited packs, but now that I have unlocked over 60% of the worlds, I need to write a better review.  I will still maintain my opinion when I say that I wouldn’t recommend this game to people, but now I will add more as to why.  The pros: Since I am a crossover fan artist and fanfic writer, I get to create my fictional anime and cartoon characters and see them interact in a unique setting. I know this may make a lot of people cringe, but at least I get to see Mavis Dracula interact with Alucard from Castlevania in a cutesy brother/sister-like relationship. I even get a lot of fanfic inspiration stories from seeing my fictional characters interact with one another. The other good thing is creating my own unique buildings and homes (best building tools if you want something fast and non-complicated) then I use them as background references for my comics & mangas. It really helps a lot and cuts down on time and work. So it’s not a total waste of my time, is what I want to say. And those are the only good things I have to say about it.  Now the cons: It’s just like any Facebook game, but in 3D and with better graphics. it's very time-consuming. like it eats up your valuable time if you are an adult with responsibilities. One second you are on it, and the next thing you know, it’s nighttime, your house is a mess, your chores haven’t been done yet, and you missed work. Your sim equivalent lives the perfect life while yours gets neglected. It goes on and on and has no end. You need to schedule a time for this game, like one hour a week or so, in order not to lose track of your life.  This game is like a leeching spouse that keeps draining your wallet for a promise of a better and more fun relationship, but eventually, you’ll have to put it down as it’s not worth spending your money on it for the rest of your life. This game is like a drug, and you are the drug addict. You need to constantly buy new packs to have fun playing the game. Some packs have repetitive items that are just recolored, which I think is a scam. I keep telling myself that this will be the last time I waste my money on this game to pay for packs instead of saving my money for a rainy day. It’s been over 11 months since I last paid a penny for a Sims 4 pack (yay!).  I already have enough. The only reason my sister and I wanted to play this game was so that we could try the wizard, werewolf, mermaid, vampire, and alien packs. I actually wrote a review on EA and suggested that they’d make Medieval Prince Charming and Medieval Maiden outfits, with fairy and mythology outfits as well, but got rejected and scorned instead. Apparently, creating new outfits to suit the many creatures’ unique physics is a hassle, but repeating the same items in different colors and charging people over $20 for it is A-OK??? Packs that would come later for free as a daily login bonus had you just been more patient!!!  If you want to play this game, I highly recommend that you play it for free. And if you want to spend some money on it, then the wizard, werewolf, mermaid, vampire, and alien packs are more than enough. Because there are times when they do these daily bonuses where you win the items for free instead of buying them.",1419.0,Not Recommended,55,think people say actually play enjoy game full pay paywall dlc edit okay write review long time ago limited dlc unlock world need write good review still maintain opinion say recommend game people add pro since crossover fan artist fanfic writer get create fictional anime cartoon character see interact unique setting know may make lot people cringe least get see mavis dracula interact alucard castlevania cutesy brother sister like relationship even get lot fanfic inspiration story see fictional character interact one another good thing create unique building home best building tool want something fast non complicate use background reference comic mangas really help lot cut time work total waste time want say good thing say con like facebook game 3d good graphic time consume like eat valuable time adult responsibility one second next thing know nighttime house mess chore do yet miss work sims equivalent livemode perfect life get neglect go end need schedule time game like one hour week order lose track life game like leeching spouse keep drain wallet promise good fun relationship eventually put worth spend money rest life game like drug drug addict need constantly buy new dlc fun play game dlc repetitive item recolored think scam keep tell last time waste money game pay dlc instead save money rainy day month since last pay penny sims dlc yay already enough reason sister want play game try wizard werewolf mermaid vampire alien dlc actually write review ea suggest make medieval prince charming medieval maiden outfit fairy mythology outfit well get reject scorn instead apparently create new outfit suit many creature unique physic hassle repeat item different color charge people ok dlc come later free daily login bonus patient want play game highly recommend play free want spend money wizard werewolf mermaid vampire alien dlc enough time daily bonus win item free instead buy

1222670,2020-09-09,"Time to update my review I guess. When I first bought it, I deliberately didn't do a lot of internet diving on what superfans thought. And I still don't; I'm not really much into communities. My impressions remain that 1) The game has a lot of bugs and features that just don't seem to work correctly, most of which never get fixed, 2) The base game by itself is pretty boring if you want to tell any kind of unique story. 3)It takes a lot of digging to find good community-made mods; many of them will just straight break things. But hey, at least the game is open to mods!  These days, I've invested an irresponsible amount of my money into expansion packs and have a few additional thoughts: 4) Packs are generally still too expensive per unique asset/function. However, with a little patience they do ALL go on sale, and some of them are really valuable for expanding what your sims can do. Not all packs are created equal, however. I was disappointed that the restaurant and retail expansions just don't seem to work right; the staff forget the customers, it takes way too much in-game time to work through task sequences, and the number of NPCs you can involve is very limited. Sim autonomy just seems to permanently conflict with task-based sim minigames. 5) Recent expansions have integrated more global cultures, which is a big plus for me. I love being able to play around with designs that are less western-centric. 6) The overall design of the game that uses lot visits is, and will forever be, frustrating. For instance, I really wanted to design a public market, but since things like food stands need to go on a lot your sim owns, there's simply no way to get it to work as a community space. The game design fundamentally limits how you can develop relationships between sims and group dynamics. 7) There's been a lot said about the emotions system from fans of previous games. Personally, I like it as a storytelling aspect and I'm sometimes by surprised at how accurate it can be in the right framing. 8) Yes, the audience for The Sims is overwhelmingly female. But it's inexcusable that there is so few design options for male-presenting sims compared to female sims, and more ambiguous designs are even harder to come-by. 9) EA still does things for the game that feel like naked money-grabs. Some of the expansions from their other IPs, that don't fit in at all with the sims universe, are clearly cross-marketing and it's awful. The limited-time events are also deeply annoying in this way. I hate the mobile game constant-engagement model to begin with, and I especially don't need it in my solo escapist on-my-terms games.  TL;DR: If you are looking for an open-ended game that can be a big time sink and give you variety and a choice between total control to lightly-directed, and have money and patience, TS4 can be a lot of fun. But if you're new and expecting to benefit from years of updates from a polished base game, don't get your hopes too high.",1216.2,Recommended,2,time update review guess first buy deliberately lot internet dive superfans think still really much community impression remain game lot bug feature seem work correctly never get fix base game pretty boring want tell kind unique story take lot dig find good community make mods many straight break thing hey least game open mods day invest irresponsible amount money dlc dlc additional thought dlc generally still expensive per unique asset function however little patience go sale really valuable expand sims dlc create equal however disappoint restaurant retail dlc seem work right staff forget customer take way much game time work task sequence number npcs involve limited sims autonomy seem permanently conflict task base sims minigames recent dlc integrate global culture big plus love able play around design less western centric overall design game use lot visit forever frustrate instance really want design public market since thing like food stand need go lot sims own simply way get work community space game design fundamentally limit develop relationship sims group dynamic lot say emotion system fan previous game personally like storytelling aspect sometimes surprise accurate right framing yes audience sims overwhelmingly female inexcusable design option male present sims compare female sims ambiguous design even hard come ea still thing game feel like naked money grab dlc ip fit sims universe clearly cross marketing awful limited time event also deeply annoy way hate mobile game constant engagement model begin especially need solo escapist term game tl dr look open end game big time sink give variety choice total control lightly direct money patience ts4 lot fun new expect benefit year update polished base game get hope high

There are some fun built-in cheats that are fun to mess around with, and there's a fairly good amount of customization, so you can make some pretty interesting characters for your game.

I'm going to list down some of these flaws and try providing some tips on how to fix them, or just make them easier to ignore.  Starting off, one of the main flaws of the game is that if you want to own everything it offers, you have to pay a large amount of money. A lot of exciting features are only available if you pay for an expansion pack or something of the sorts, and a lot of the things that the game offers in exchange for money are considered not worth the price. A commonly used way to fix this is by downloading mods online that add new game mechanics, furniture, etc. I have never myself tried this, since I find the base game with the very few expansions I have good enough, but I've seen many people doing it and I'm sure that there are a lot of places online that state which mods they think are the best and most exciting ones.  Another flaw that I've myself gotten upset over is the fact that character customization can be pretty limited. For example, I couldn't find anything close to my hairstyle in the game, and had to settle for a slightly wavy hair (For context, I have short, curly hair). The main problem with this is that many people can't make themselves accurately in the game for reasons such as the game not having their hairstyle, their facial features, etc. The most popular way to solve this is using CC (Custom content) when making sims. CC is custom content made by players that you can use in-game, and for some people, it makes a huge difference.  I wouldn't necessarily consider this a flaw of the game, but people often find themselves getting bored and running out of ideas for what to do, since this game doesn't directly give you a goal or objective. An easy way to solve this is to try setting a crazy goal for your sim and making rules to how you will achieve that goal or trying to successfully follow a storyline. Those were just examples, but there are very easy ways to prevent boredom in the sims 4.  This game has many more flaws than that, but those are the main ones I've encountered. Overall, I just find this game enjoyable and think it's chaotic and rather funny, so I would recommend it.",846.8,Recommended,22,game definitely many flaw issue despite find fairly enjoyable time play game great way pass time opinion play genuinely without use ton cheat even feel quite reward lot interesting time slightly questionable feature discover play various time experiment game ton thing fun buildmode cheat fun mess around fairly good amount customization make pretty interesting character game although enjoy game like game course flaw go list flaw try provide tip fix make easy ignore start one main flaw game want everything offer pay large amount money lot excite feature available pay dlc dlc something sort lot thing game offer exchange money consider worth price commonly used way fix download mods online add new game mechanic furniture never try since find base game dlc good enough see many people sure lot place online state mods think best exciting one another flaw gotten upset fact character customization pretty limited example find anything close hairstyle game settle slightly wavy hair context short curly hair main problem many people make accurately game reason game hairstyle facial feature popular way solve use cc custom content make sims cc custom content make player use game people make huge difference necessarily consider flaw game people often find get bored run idea since game directly give goal objective easy way solve try set crazy goal sims make rule achieve goal try successfully follow storyline example easy way prevent boredom sims game many flaw main one encounter overall find game enjoyable think chaotic rather funny recommend

1222670,2023-07-30,"I kind of wish Steam had a ""Maybe"" or ""Sort Of"" option, because Sims 4 has the POTENTIAL to be a good game, but because EA is so money-hungry it can't even be bothered to put out *barely* functional content. The Wedding Stories pack completely breaks weddings (even worse than they are in the base game), created Kits just so they could drain even more money from us (and, quite frankly, we're still being WAY too patient with EA at this point). This is definitely a pricey game, which is ironic given that's it's (now) free to play. It's over *$1000* to buy ALL of the DLC, which I'll break down for you right here:  $560 for all 14 Expansion Packs (some of which include features like playable school and careers, weather, pets, and university, which you need to pay extra money for in a LIFE SIMULATOR, plus other feature such as the ability to live in cities, islands, and mountains)  $240 for all 12 Game Packs, which are features like supernatural beings (werewolves, vampires, etc.), camping, restaurants, spas, the aforementioned broken Wedding Stories pack, and then the ever-shameless Journey to Batuu Star Wars tie-in. Oh, and there's another one (Strangerville) that's basically a parody of Stranger Things (shocking, I know) that lasts like a good hour or so before the story's over.  $180 for all 18 Stuff Packs, which are usually just collections of furniture, clothes, and a few new gameplay features that aren't big enough to warrant being a Game Pack. One of these is My First Pet Stuff, which is infamous for being DLC for DLC, as you need to own the Cats & Dogs Expansion Pack in order to even use this one. Yeah. You can't even have a hamster unless you pay $40 dollars extra for another, MUCH larger pack.  ...and then we have the Kits. The *Kits.* These are basically just pieces of content EA purposely took out of other packs so that they could treat their (self-admittedly) overly-loyal fans like cash cows. The best examples of this are the Bust the Dust and Throwback Fit Kits, two of the first three Kits EA released (both of which I am slightly ashamed to admit I actually bought when they first came out; this was just before I realized how scummy EA truly was towards Sims fans). The content in the Bust the Dust Kit, whose whole thing was that it had functioning vacuums and would cause dust to start appearing in your Sims' house whether or not you had a vacuum in it, could've have been lumped in with the Laundry Day Stuff Pack, and the content from the Throwback Fit Kit (which is, get this; JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF RETRO ATHLETIC WEAR) could have easily, EASILY been added to the Fitness Stuff Pack (I don't think I need to explain the logic behind that one). And Kits were first launched in March of 2021, and as of writing this review, July 2023, there are 23 Kits in the Sims 4. Look back at every other category of DLC I've listed in this review. All of those have been around since the 2010's, and yet not a single one of them has hit 20 through this game's entire run, with the highest (the Stuff Packs) only hitting 18, and yet the Kits, which have only existed for like two years, have already TOPPED them and will likely continue to do so! And while yes, the Kits are only $5 each, that's gonna add up eventually, so...  ...$115 for all 23 Kits. If we combine the prices for ALL of the DLC in this game, that brings us to the mind-numbing, wallet-draining total of $1,095 for EVERY SINGLE DLC in a FREE TO PLAY life simulator which, speaking from experience, is EXTREMELY empty without it! The base game is very empty, especially once you play it after buying a large amount of the DLC. Interaction between sims is boring at best to incoherent or nonexistent at worst, Clothing choices are bland, and please, PLEASE don't make me talk about how bad the skin tones were back when the game first launched.  All in all, Sims 4 is just kind You either need a LOT of DLC or a LOT of high quality custom content to make it worth playing for long periods of time, but if you're just looking for something to mess around in for a bit, then it's fine.

1222670,2024-07-02,"Beware that this game dlc's cost fortune. There are some nitpicks I have with Sims 4.

Aside these, I find Sims 4 to be fun to play, you have more control over various sims, unlike in Sims 3 where playing more then one family was next to impossible. The game is also way less buggy then 3's were, and performance is night and day comparison. However character creation (sims don't look ugly like in 3's), more leniant gameplay, the general details like various mood modifiers - this game has these plenty, the overall ease of use, not restricted to just one family thus bridging gap between gameplay lost of Sims 1 and 2 to bridge burner Sims 3 .. I consider 4's a good step. Especially now visually Sims now can look truly goregous, unlike even in Sims 2. Ah and game doesn't make monsters from townies - Sims 2 generated aesthetic abominations A LOT which was proving difficult if you are for legacy challenge playing.  No, I have no issue that Sims 4 isn't continuation of 1,2 and 3 in straight timeline.

Half of the game is locked until you spend 500 dollars on dlcs. Also there is no autosaving and to play you have to download other software. The game is prone to random crashes and since there is no autosaving if you dont constantly save you can lose hours of work.

There is barely even a tutorial and the menus are so confusing I had to spend half an hour alone just figuring out what the menus do. Dont buy unless you want to spend have your time playing saving and are ready to pay a ridiculous amount of money for dlcs. I dont reccomend this game.

OK, so, it's a people simulation game. It's cute, in way. It's also clearly dated.  Super bare-bones in the base game it's painfully obvious that the game allowed for extensions of gameplay with DLC, right? Right! So I check out the DLCs, seeing stuff in many respects that should have been in the base game already but weren't - some very obvious things. And then... I looked at the prices.  WTF.  Seriously, even with 30% discount across the board it's still way over €500?... I don't know what EA is thinking here but they effectively made me turn away from such a blatant display of greed with that. DLC prices that have been kept at launch prices since 2014, even with the launch prices being stupid-high as well. So the bottom line is I won't even be buying the base game at a deep discount now because it's incomplete, and I don't plan on paying full game level prices for each DLC to just add something obvious. Or just a few new outfits. I mean: I get that adding stuff to a game takes effort, but if after 6 years you still keep the prices at launch prices you've gone way beyond getting ROI and are just milking your players for more.

1222670,2020-07-09,"Base Game: 9 out of 10 but I'm DLC biased DLC: Great gameplay but absolutely destroyed by price; 5 out of 10 For full-package game collectors: Hard 4 out of 10.  README IF YOU HAVE THIS WITH ANY DLC ON ORIGIN:  So I have an odd special review for people in the odd predicament where they already have this on Origin with a ton of the DLC already. If you have it on Origin and you already have a collossal ass-ton of DLC on there, you can actually buy the BASE GAME here on steam, and Origin will add all the DLC. YOU DO NOT have to buy the DLC twice if your wanting to go from Origin to Steam, only the base game. The price of the base game has nothing against the price of all the DLC as I'm sure you may know. As it currently stands, half my DLC is from origin and the other half is here on steam, so I know it works (you do gotta tinker a'lil). Ignore my playtime by the way as I've played a bit on Origin. If you do do this I recommend on the sims 4 store page here on steam clicking the dropdown arrow on all the DLC you already own on Origin and click ""ignore"" which greys them out on steam to kinda indicate to yourself you already have them on Origin. It really helps any confusion and keeps you from accidentally Double-Dipping DLC lol.  As far as the game review itself goes it genuinely is a really great game but stupid stupid STUPID expensive if you want the whole package with all DLC. While I recommend the game and DLC I also at the same time cannot in good conscience say that the price involving the DLC is AT ALL fair, not even close, not even a teeny-tiny bit. I am honestly as appalled and disgusted by the price of the DLC as I possibly can be. It literally doesn't get worse than this, just putting that out there xD. IF YOU MUST and are (R@zY like me for the love of GabeN wait for the DLC to go on sale as low as it can frikkin go. If your a game collector that seeks the full package from your games then EA developers are gonna bend you over and buttfk you with an XL spiked strapon (no lube).

1222670,2021-06-16,"Alright, so here's the scoop: I'm a huge fan of the Sims, and, like most of the other reviewers, I've seen the evolution of Sims games. Sims 3 was absolutely phenomenal - I loved it! When Sims 4 was announced, I hopped on the hype train, ready to have a great experience.  But I didn't. What a lot of people don't know, is that The Sims 4 launched missing several key features from previous installments including the removal of the ""Toddler"" life state, and the removal of family trees. Traits have been pruned into the oblivion, so with the base game you only get about 15 to choose from as opposed to the 30-40 from the base game of 3. Some of the missing features were eventually patched in after EA received a lot of backlash for it, but the game still feels empty.  == Pros == *A LOT less lag than Sims 3 - my worlds don't take 15 minutes to load. *Graphics are more vibrant than they were in previous titles. *Build Mode has been greatly improved, and allows for a much better experiencing when creating homes and buildings. *Sims now have moods that affect their actions and how they interact with others - i.e. angry sims stomp around, and scared sims have the option to take a ""nervous poop"".  == Cons == *One of the best and most interesting things about The Sims 3 was that the map was much more open world. Zoom out of your house and see whose visiting the local parks, the community pool, entering and exiting buildings. You could control your sims even if they're all the way across town. The Sims 4 does not let you do this. Neighborhoods are sectioned off, so each one has a loading screen when travelling between them. If you go to visit a gym in another neighborhood, you have to take control of either that sim alone at the gym, or the rest of the family back home. You can switch between whose active, but you can't control both at the same time. *A lot of furniture and items that were available in the base game of Sims 3 are now locked behind DLCs. *Several years later, I noticed bugs where I command my Sim to do something, and they just stand there, staring at nothing. This sometimes requires a restart if it goes on for too long. *You can no longer control your pets. This is one of my least favorite changes between 3 and 4. In Sims 3, you had the ability to control your pets. *There's a lot less life states to play as in this game - 3 had pixies, witches, werewolves, vampires, and genies which all had their own unique wishes, lifestyles, and gameplay elements. *You can no longer create custom patterns or choose colors from a color wheel when in Create-a-Sim, or when placing furniture. You are bound to whatever choices of colors there are by default. This absolutely murdered creativity.  The Sims 4, although I enjoy playing it and creating Sims and homes, is a shell of it's former self. Do yourselves a favor, only buy this game when it's on sale, especially the DLC. There's over $1000 worth of DLC now, with some of the DLC costing as much as the game itself, if not more.  EA should be ashamed of their business models in nearly every game they've released in the past 10 years.

I just dive right onto the latest , i've had this first on console but switched to pc instead :D .I can say that it's fun specially now that, First- it can drop its price at a friggin 88% off when sale, (i bought it on full price back then btw, both on console and pc). Second- Now, this year, surprisingly has been very interesting and- enjoyable i must admit. Aside from the dlcs always on sale ,(but still pricey), they are constantly adding something new to the base game. And now with the new update that adds more realism? I mean, before, your sims LIFE is like so perfect with just little moodlets to let them down, and everything is just so perfectly boring and it lacks more interaction and stuff like u know, gameplay? I mostly just spend time on build mode. Now with their new update, neighbors can have their own stories and drama-YOUR household CAN have more drama, and it can be a total mess! (happened to me apparently) Its just small autonomy stuff and you're totally in control if you dont want it,but it added more life to the game! And of course the new sim delivery, new scenario(which i never tried), and basically new gameplay. They added more color swatches last year to some base game outfits and to some build items as well. (maxis have been quite active this past year) there is so much going on now that i have to spend more time on live mode than i ever did. Maybe thats why im posting a review just now. i'm always finding something new lately on cas or build mode. they keep updating the game to make it more immersive than it used to be. and i appreciate that. BUT of course it will be much more fun when you add some of its DLC :) ps: i only buy dlc when its on sale, cause even in 50% off-its still a bit pricey alright.

1222670,2024-09-30,"I still enjoy the Sims 4, I'd say it can be as cozy as you want to make it. You can get the base game for free these days, no high seas necessary. I have loads of DLC but I'm not sure starting out now I'd re-buy more than a few of them.  If you are not on console and can play mods/cheats a few key ones can make the game much less stressful if you just want to lightly play.  Others get into challenges and such, which I never do. I build and I play single people then get them into families. I don't have the patience for multi-generation play, but the game is what you want to make it.",50.2,Recommended,17,still enjoy sims say cozy want make get base game free day high sea necessary load dlc sure start buy console play mods cheat key one make game much less stressful want lightly play others get challenge never buildmode play single people get family patience multi generation play game want make

1222670,2020-06-30,"After the unapologetically bugged Sims 3, I honestly thought it couldn't get worse with Sims 4, but EA has not failed to surprise. Actually I let EA surprise me despite my better judgment. This garbage was released in 2014, and so little work obviously went into polishing and straightening out.  1 minute in: The end of first day. He goes to bed. I thought he would wake up when he was fully rested or something and intentionally didn't force him to wake up, I let him sleep as long as he wanted. A little too much couldn't hurt. He sleeps for about 20 hours straight and consequently woke up famished and immediately peed himself.  10 minutes in: I make him wake up (of course). He does wake up (good for EA), but the sleep icon bottom-left doesn't go away. It just stays there. I can do other things, but it just won't go away. OK. Whatever. EA after all. What did I expect? Then I do some stuff, days pass: It stays there. Doesn't cause any inconvenience other than the impression it gives that EA doesn't disappoint. OK. Whatever.  25 minutes in: Now another icon gets stuck there right on top of the sleep icon. Again it doesn't affect the gameplay. I'll let it slide this time, too.  30 minutes in: Next day. He eats. I order him to clean up his plate. The icon disappears about a second after it looks like he's going to do it. Then he just stops. Minds his business. Clean up the plate, please? Again the same thing. He won't do it. OK. Whatever. I can place the darn plate in the trash myself. Problem solved, right?  Bunch of hours in: The stuck icons go away when I save and exit. Maybe that has to do with him not doing what I told him to do. I can just save and exit every time the icon gets stuck. The two bugs turn out to be unrelated. No activity icons are stuck, but he still persistently won't clean up his plate OR take out the trash. Or rather, he takes the trash and drops it before leaving the house EVERY SINGLE TIME. Hmm. OK..  6 hours in: Certain actions randomly become undoable just whenever. It would be tolerable perhaps if this bug was limited to minor actions like cleaning up, but now he won't go to work. I spent half an hour trying to make him go to work. Saved and exited multiple times. Nothing works.  Finally: I start a new game. Maybe something was wrong with the previous one. A car was stuck somewhere in town? A fish tried to hop out of the water but couldn't so the game understandably had to go haywire? The usual Sims 3 circus shenanigans could be happening and breaking the game. I start a new game. My sim goes to bed at the end of the day. I let him sleep until the bar is fully green, and I tell him to wake up in the morning. 3 hours until his shift. We got stuff to do before that. He won't wake up. I break the wake up command. He sleeps like a baby. He has been sleeping now for close to 2 days, and I guess he's about to die peacefully in his sleep. Soon he'll be out of his misery at least.  EA, my dears.

The Sims 4 is ok apart from its unbelievable loading times (on a very solid machine that has no trouble with other titles), and gameplay that many have said is a step backwards from Sims 3.

1222670,2022-11-07,"Don't. I've spent almost or about $1000 on this series. I've played it for thousands of hours. I transferred my game over from Origin because Origin sucks. My hours on Steam do not reflect the hours of my life I've given to this game. Every single time, as of a few months ago, that I want to boot up this game I stop myself. I know I will be enjoying myself and run into something game breaking.  Look, I have been playing The Sims religiously since Sims 1, buying all the expansions. Been playing this series religiously since I was a teenager well into adulthood. Sims 1. Sims 2. Sims 3. And all the little expansions. While the games could always get buggy and weird I had faith that the developers would work it out. The Sims 4 is unplayable for me at times. In fact, back in November of last year (2021) it became COMPLETELY unplayable, with Sims freezing and doing nothing. This happens too often. TOO OFTEN!!! I can't enjoy this game anymore!!!!  Things are not getting fixed and I'm MAD about it! I've spent too much money and TIME for it to be such a bad experience almost every time I boot this game up.  The Sims 5???? I don't want it!!! FIX THIS GAME!  UPDATE 1/4/2024: I'm an addict so I always return to this game. I no longer purchase packs at full price but I'm still here. Stuff that's always been broken are still broken, what's new?
