early access review preface review saying battlegrounds means complete well optimized current state however mean unplayable despite short amount time game say much better counterpart king kill number reasons weapon variety much somewhat balanced grow number mechanics game much realistic less buggy comparison counterpart jump cars flying speed light live weapons actually hit aim least along bullet drop thing tons servers already often least playable one account leave game due horrendous lag beautiful game highest settings although nearly impossible play said settings effectively due poor optimization thus fps issues steam market already includes game game skins items available characters another thing worth relatively easy earn reward points simply playing game purchase crates randomly drop said skins game actually feels fun fair play minute number instances feel like killed due poor game design game means complete absolute best thing played thus far extremely promising battle royale arma series extremely fun little slow paced seemed number problems fundamental game success playability battlegrounds appears setting new standard battle royale type games
hackers already issue free play anyone hack without hope devs something cheaters anything payed players nothing get done free players
autistic many games challenging specifically games protect enemies often nearby pubg completely changed gaming given confidence play solo able survive game
game ruined servers gone ping base devs allowed game go ruin hackers cheaters terrible game content installing hours wasted

good game since game became free many player using hack system destroy experience love game much especially lot player using hack system china since heard using advertisement hope something
really want like game really good especially compared br options worth money game much potential devs screwed gave game many chances add battle pass thing stupid already paid dollars poorly optimized buggy game instead fixing add something free charge netcode absolute garbage screen shoot guy face times server side take damage countless bugs annoying game breaking making lose something fault game fun time really wanted good game huge fan long good spend money elsewhere
one best games also worst time give review game game left early access still well optimized bluehole supposed keep cheaters hackers away every damn game end cheater hacker shoots walls away aimbots love game hate time instead fixing issues keep giving new crates weapon skin need buy keys open crates developers happy amount made already seem greedy money rather fixing issues get issues fixed first update review
developer one least responsive innovative team far battle royale genre devs focus things like clothing map effects addition game items traps instead fixing big item issues like chinese hackers high ping lobbies game optimization broken physics american servers love weekly updates prime time hours pm time update breaks game take bluehole week finally realize back dumb things bluehole actually good dev still million players playing
game perfect anyone likes rage quit start playing
fun longer fun overall save dolla dolla bills
desync lag game due poor netcode low server tick rate developers limiting high ping players servers hit client side makes terribly frustrating play constantly dying behind cover get good game learn use terrible netcode advantage enjoy gameplay lot ruined dying due awful networking seem focus making new paid crates know game survive long term recommend game despite playing hours thought stuff improve time somewhat invested really waiting better alternative

game unbalanced honestly single dude come anywhere along team mates seconds audio especially footsteps broken teammate walking next sometimes game decides throw random sound outside across area thus giving info heard someone elsewhere
played free week either get matched level sweats btw camper spot known man shoots without seeing away iron sight best game ever
buy game purchase game years ago banned without proof hack cheat investigate watching replay also found broken anti cheat detect something banned glitches every update last two years still going strong save money buy game
game fun especially friends think years development fix optimize game point people safely play without worry crashing lagging even getting actual gunfights think even porting game mobile console actually focus fixing un optimized state game day nothing changed game horribly un optimized many others deal even able load game due recent update player loss adding bots game tell wait solos duo lobby minutes get real players bots effort help new players stay alive longer get wrong like get repetitive boring challenges done easier abusing bots gets stale game required actively find ways make game playable playing around graphics settings outside game hopefully game gets better future recent changes efforts improving stability performance low hopes
game like ex girlfriend cant get rid much try push away keeps back life good honestly though every update mostly makes game better casually playing since alpha see far come insane hopefully free play new player base far best realistic battle royale game
