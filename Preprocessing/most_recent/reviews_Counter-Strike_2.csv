This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point.

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers.

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point.

There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”","1,770.6",2561291,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”","1,770.6",2561291,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO.....

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

However, the cheaters... premier matchmaking... faceit...  You decided to break all of it, the entire game. Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence...  Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game...  You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback.

Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list.

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update.

You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback.

Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list.

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen.

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”","1,770.6",2561291,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

Practice all necessary skills for the Game - AIM -> Deathmatch; Aim-Maps; Practice-Maps (Recoilmaster etc.) - Movement -> Climb-servers; Surfing, Prefire-Maps (Shortcuts from Yesber too) - Gamesense -> Matchmaking; Retake-Servers - Mapknowledge -> Callouts; Demos from your favourite Pro-Player, - Nades -> pls learn them - Roles -> Entry; Support; Lurk; AWPer   - Train your Habit (first callout then flame) - play daily to to improve your aim - make pauses every 2-3 games to reset (go outside from the room with your Pc) - stop at the point you get mad (after a loss may)   If you follow all these Steps you will be able to climb the ladder and improve fast.

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence...  Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game...  You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback. Counter Strike has one of the most dedicated communities and I am sure if you paid even a fraction of it back to us that investment would pay off ten fold for you guys.","3,195.7",154749157,0,Recommended

There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form.","2,366.0",6935781,0,Recommended

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Don't get me wrong, I approve CS2, but removing CSGO entirely just makes me mad.  Update 26 Feb 2025: Still a downvote. CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun. Others don't even know that they have to plant the bomb xD.  You get the picture.","5,391.2",4932149151,0,Recommended

2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.0",369303,0,Recommended

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better.

You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback.

Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list.

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen.

2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Don't get me wrong, I approve CS2, but removing CSGO entirely just makes me mad.  Update 26 Feb 2025: Still a downvote. CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun. Others don't even know that they have to plant the bomb xD.  You get the picture.","5,391.2",4932149151,0,Recommended

2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.0",369303,0,Recommended

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill.

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence...  Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game...  You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback.

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun.

2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.0",369303,0,Recommended

It just made these guns you would buy on a whim utterly useless since they now take a slot where an objectively better gun could've been. The M249 has now become even more redundant. Also, any previously downloaded matches are gone, so now you can no longer watch them. Isn't this game supposed to be a sequel/upgrade to CS:GO? Why are there ZERO new maps/weapons?

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”","1,770.6",2561291,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

Practice all necessary skills for the Game - AIM -> Deathmatch; Aim-Maps; Practice-Maps (Recoilmaster etc.) - Movement -> Climb-servers; Surfing, Prefire-Maps (Shortcuts from Yesber too) - Gamesense -> Matchmaking; Retake-Servers - Mapknowledge -> Callouts; Demos from your favourite Pro-Player, - Nades -> pls learn them - Roles -> Entry; Support; Lurk; AWPer   - Train your Habit (first callout then flame) - play daily to to improve your aim - make pauses every 2-3 games to reset (go outside from the room with your Pc) - stop at the point you get mad (after a loss may)   If you follow all these Steps you will be able to climb the ladder and improve fast.

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

However, the cheaters... premier matchmaking... faceit...  You decided to break all of it, the entire game. Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence...  Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game...  You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback. Counter Strike has one of the most dedicated communities and I am sure if you paid even a fraction of it back to us that investment would pay off ten fold for you guys.","3,195.7",154749157,0,Recommended

There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list.

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun.

2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.0",369303,0,Recommended

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”","1,770.6",2561291,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

Practice all necessary skills for the Game - AIM -> Deathmatch; Aim-Maps; Practice-Maps (Recoilmaster etc.) - Movement -> Climb-servers; Surfing, Prefire-Maps (Shortcuts from Yesber too) - Gamesense -> Matchmaking; Retake-Servers - Mapknowledge -> Callouts; Demos from your favourite Pro-Player, - Nades -> pls learn them - Roles -> Entry; Support; Lurk; AWPer   - Train your Habit (first callout then flame) - play daily to to improve your aim - make pauses every 2-3 games to reset (go outside from the room with your Pc) - stop at the point you get mad (after a loss may)   If you follow all these Steps you will be able to climb the ladder and improve fast.

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.

However, the cheaters... premier matchmaking... faceit...  You decided to break all of it, the entire game. Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence...  Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game...  You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback. Counter Strike has one of the most dedicated communities and I am sure if you paid even a fraction of it back to us that investment would pay off ten fold for you guys.","3,195.7",154749157,0,Recommended

There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form.","2,366.0",6935781,0,Recommended

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun.

2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.0",369303,0,Recommended

2018-06-16 00:00:00,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta. It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also. I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!!  It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service. It's funny how things happen!!  Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad. There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me. Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from. The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!). Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy? If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for??? Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).  My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.? There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service? It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?! Who know's? Certainly nobody in the community, why? No communication. Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to? A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.  Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.  Cheers Chris  P.S. UPDATE - My hours are incorrect. My pc is never off for other reasons and CS is running in the background idling just like my AV.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours. When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees. Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly. Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess. Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove from the oil and place on paper towels.

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

One game, you’re part of a The next, your teammate is crouch-walking into a wall while blasting in voice chat.           This game will test your patience, your reflexes, and your will to live. It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”","1,770.6",2561291,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence...  Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game...  You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback.

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun.

2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.0",369303,0,Recommended

The load-out system is odd and a bit pointless - why would I ever use the PP-Bizon or Sawed-Off over any other SMG or shotgun? It just made these guns you would buy on a whim utterly useless since they now take a slot where an objectively better gun could've been. The M249 has now become even more redundant. Also, any previously downloaded matches are gone, so now you can no longer watch them. Isn't this game supposed to be a sequel/upgrade to CS:GO? Why are there ZERO new maps/weapons? I'm sure in time they'll add back some of the missing things I complained about since Baggage is literally featured in a screenshot on the store page, but for now, it's seriously lacking.  4 months later - Arms Race is back with a whopping TWO MAPS!",603.5,189839120,0,Recommended

2018-06-16 00:00:00,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta. It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also. I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!!  It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service. It's funny how things happen!!  Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad. There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me. Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from. The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!). Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy? If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for??? Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).  My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.? There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service? It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?! Who know's? Certainly nobody in the community, why? No communication. Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to? A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.  Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.  Cheers Chris  P.S. UPDATE - My hours are incorrect. My pc is never off for other reasons and CS is running in the background idling just like my AV.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours. When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees. Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly. Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess. Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove from the oil and place on paper towels.

2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.6",8542440,0,Recommended

2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,77718116,0,Recommended

2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight","2,142.6",351252,0,Recommended

Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO.....

You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this.

2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,113.9",20775,0,Recommended

A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen.

2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Don't get me wrong, I approve CS2, but removing CSGO entirely just makes me mad.  Update 26 Feb 2025: Still a downvote. CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun. Others don't even know that they have to plant the bomb xD.  You get the picture.","5,391.2",4932149151,0,Recommended

2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.0",369303,0,Recommended

It just made these guns you would buy on a whim utterly useless since they now take a slot where an objectively better gun could've been. The M249 has now become even more redundant. Also, any previously downloaded matches are gone, so now you can no longer watch them. Isn't this game supposed to be a sequel/upgrade to CS:GO? Why are there ZERO new maps/weapons?

2018-06-16 00:00:00,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta. It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also. I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!!  It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service. It's funny how things happen!!  Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad. There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me. Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from. The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!). Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy? If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for??? Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).  My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.? There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service? It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?! Who know's? Certainly nobody in the community, why? No communication. Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to? A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.  Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.  Cheers Chris  P.S. UPDATE - My hours are incorrect. My pc is never off for other reasons and CS is running in the background idling just like my AV.

Mix it thoroughly. Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess. Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible.
