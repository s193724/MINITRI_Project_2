2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

""Unauthorized software"" and ""Data Manipulation"" I've never cheated on a steam game and I don't even know how. I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It's not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response, can't even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I've heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it's ridiculous.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

""Unauthorized software"" and ""Data Manipulation"" I've never cheated on a steam game and I don't even know how. I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It's not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response, can't even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I've heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it's ridiculous.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

Download Warzone (instead of actually installing Warzone it downloads a COD launcher, as well as MW3 and MW2 even though I don't own either)  3. Open the game, scroll down to Warzone and click the only option available, DMZ.  4. Game closes MW3, opens MW2, downloads 2 sets of updates for both launchers even though I don't OWN EITHER, and then tries to sell me MW2  5. Go back to main launcher and click the grayed out ""you don't own this DLC""  6. Tells me to download Warzone.  7. Crashes twice during the ACTUAL download of Warzone even though I meet recommended specs.  I just downloaded 80GB of bs just to download another 10GB to play the game I originally went through all this for, and then when I finally figure out where to download it, IT WON'T LET ME!

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene.

Have Fun!   [0084] In another example, the 'accuracy of enemy attacks' may call for modifications provided to high skill level players that involve 'enemy attacks never missing the player', whereas, modifications provided to low skill level players may involve 'enemy attacks sometimes missing the player'. Accordingly, a table, database, or other dataset includes an “enemies attacks” entry, wherein a different value is separately assigned to each skill level and wherein each of the different values is associated with an accuracy of enemies attack, with higher skill levels having values associated therewith a greater accuracy of enemies attack and with lower skill levels having values associated therewith a lower accuracy of enemies attack  [0092] Once an assessment is made, the computer program that executes the gaming environment modifies elements of the session and/or gameplay parameters as the session is being created based on the aggregate skill level. In embodiments, session modifications may include, but are not limited to: adjusting the number of enemies, adjusting the complexity of puzzles; and player adjustments, which may include players' health, damage, speed, available abilities, and difficulty level. In one embodiment, the players' health are scaled based on the aggregate skill level.",6.6,176377154,0,Recommended
2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed. This may be a bit of a slow process as I am moving to university soon but it is not forgotten!","1,062.6",11066176,0,Recommended

2023-10-06 00:00:00,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.,43.7,931935,0,Recommended

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

Accordingly, a table, database, or other dataset includes an “enemies attacks” entry, wherein a different value is separately assigned to each skill level and wherein each of the different values is associated with an accuracy of enemies attack, with higher skill levels having values associated therewith a greater accuracy of enemies attack and with lower skill levels having values associated therewith a lower accuracy of enemies attack  [0092] Once an assessment is made, the computer program that executes the gaming environment modifies elements of the session and/or gameplay parameters as the session is being created based on the aggregate skill level.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

""Unauthorized software"" and ""Data Manipulation"" I've never cheated on a steam game and I don't even know how. I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It's not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response, can't even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I've heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it's ridiculous.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

I’ve never cheated or engaged in any behavior that would justify this kind of punishment.  The ban is completely unjustified, and the support from Activision has been non-existent. I’ve tried appealing multiple times, but they haven’t provided any explanation. The only unusual thing I did was run Steam’s “verify integrity of game files” after the game crashed during launch. I can’t help but feel like the anti-cheat system mistakenly flagged this as some kind of manipulation, which is ridiculous.  I’m writing this review to warn others.

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had. This wasn't just another year of Call of Duty, this was Modern Warfare 2, a title whose legacy is clearly far too heavy for MWII to raise.",84.4,277713,0,Recommended
2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps.

Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed.

I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

I can’t help but feel like the anti-cheat system mistakenly flagged this as some kind of manipulation, which is ridiculous.  I’m writing this review to warn others. If you’re considering playing this game, be cautious. Even with a spotless gaming history, you could end up banned without ever playing. It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wouldn’t want anyone else to go through the same.",53.3,2501322,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had.

Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended

MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had.

Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had. This wasn't just another year of Call of Duty, this was Modern Warfare 2, a title whose legacy is clearly far too heavy for MWII to raise.",84.4,277713,0,Recommended

Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through.

Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I've heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it's ridiculous.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed. This may be a bit of a slow process as I am moving to university soon but it is not forgotten!","1,062.6",11066176,0,Recommended

2023-10-06 00:00:00,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.,43.7,931935,0,Recommended

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended

December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended

I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).

2023-03-23 00:00:00,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare II is like ordering that one dish you always got at a restaurant you've been eating at for the past 18 years, only to start eating and realise that the recipe has changed. So you keep going, and you keep ordering, and you keep trying it out in hopes that one day it'll taste the way it used to, but it never does.  The game looks like COD, but hardly feels or plays like the COD you used to know and you don't know why. No amount of updates and backpedalling can change the way that it just doesn't feel right. So you move on, and you leave utterly disappointed and apathetic to this treasured series.",5.2,9765182,0,Recommended
2023-08-05 00:00:00,"I would write a full review, but I'd rather not spend more time on this game than I already have. Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.  Thanks for coming to my review, I will leave comments open, because unlike Activision and Infinity Ward, I like feedback.",452.5,932107169,0,Recommended
2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended

December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended

MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).

Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games. Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

2023-10-06 00:00:00,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.,43.7,931935,0,Recommended

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended

December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended

I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).

Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.  Thanks for coming to my review, I will leave comments open, because unlike Activision and Infinity Ward, I like feedback.",452.5,932107169,0,Recommended
2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

Literally no one likes it and the fact that games restart multiple times when switching between them renders the concept of all games being on the same launcher screen useless. All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games. Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite. Really we should be blaming EPIC Games for the COD launcher; maybe the heads of Activision believe enough microtransaction slop and confusing menu screens will make their game as profitable as Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would've had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you're considering buying this game, don't do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can't let $70 go to waste.  EDIT: Steam told me I played an additional 11 hours and asked me to revise my review.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

Don't even want to be reminded of the constant trap I keep falling into each year with this dogsht mediocre franchise.  Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium ♥♥♥♥ like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content. Progression is insanely slow and there is a premium version of the premium battlepass. Yes you read that correctly. You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.  BIG BIG BIG issue for me personally is too many ****ing menus, tabs, buttons to press things on the screen. You open the ****ing game and god forbid you press anything cause every button somehow opens a menu.. Who actually designed this UI???. Its like looking at a gas station bathroom wall of ADVERTISEMENTS of the very game you are playing at that moment.

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

2023-10-06 00:00:00,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.,43.7,931935,0,Recommended

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had. This wasn't just another year of Call of Duty, this was Modern Warfare 2, a title whose legacy is clearly far too heavy for MWII to raise.",84.4,277713,0,Recommended

2023-08-05 00:00:00,"I would write a full review, but I'd rather not spend more time on this game than I already have. Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games. Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would've had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you're considering buying this game, don't do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can't let $70 go to waste.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

""Unauthorized software"" and ""Data Manipulation"" I've never cheated on a steam game and I don't even know how. I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It's not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response, can't even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I've heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it's ridiculous.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had.

Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games. Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would've had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you're considering buying this game, don't do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can't let $70 go to waste.

I admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging, but after investing over 200 hours each in MWII (2022) and MWIII (2023), the gameplay hasn't justified the time and money spent. There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.",586.3,253318,0,Recommended

2023-03-05 00:00:00,"If you're here for the campaign, it's not worth 70USD If you're here for the nostalgia from playing vigorously a decade ago, you'll be disappointed If you're here because you think it's a good time to get back into Call of Duty, you're mistaken If you're here because you think that maybe, just maybe, this Call of Duty will be better compared to Vanguard or Modern Warfare (2019), trust me, it won't be.  I've played Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops, Black Ops II, Ghosts, Modern Warfare (2019), Vanguard, and this one, Modern Warfare 2 (2022)  The reason for me buying this one was because I'm a victim of the first paragraph in this review. I thought it would be better than the previous recent Call of Duty games, I thought it was time I returned, I thought there was hope that it would be better. I was WRONG.  With each new Call of Duty release, the UI (User Interface) looks more and more stupid, impractical, clunky, confusing, a menu within menu within menu slogfest. The gunsmith system is completely complex for no reason, but is advertised as innovative and easy. If you want a certain gun, you have to earn it by playing other guns, which require playing other guns, which require playing a starter gun. Bloody why?  The maps, don't get me started, there is no creativity behind the maps, for 70USD you're basically getting 4 maps but on rotation, and if new maps come out, guess what, it's a reskin of a map from an older cod title that came out a decade ago. Nuketown, Terminal, Dome, Shipment you know all these maps at some point in your ""CoD Career"" because they keep reusing them rather than giving us new fresh maps. And when they do give us fresh maps, it's completely horrible anyways.  Each Call of Duty game announces themselves with the slogan ""Going back to our roots"" or ""Boots on the ground"", if I had a dollar for every time I saw that, I'd be a billionaire. Truth is, there is no innovation, the franchise is undead (Dead but still alive when it shouldn't be). Battlefield 2042 flopped and Call of Duty got more popular but it seriously needs to die, because these studios, CEOs and big shot bastards are so comfortable with the easy money that we put in their pockets. They release lazy new games and call it innovation and we're all mindless sheep that still hold on to the hope that we can relive what it was like when we played Call of Duty growing up. For these past few years I had that hope, but NO MORE. I'm officially done with Call of Duty and Battlefield, it's just saddening that people will not realise that they're just being taken advantage of. I've realised it and I'm no longer going to support these half-baked games that haven't changed in forever, let the series die already and come up with something brand new.  There's a reason why the peak of Call of Duty games were in its infancy, for me personally, it was Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and 3, Black Ops 1 & 2, and Ghosts (I know people didn't like this one, but everything is subjective). What you fell in love with was the banter in voice chat lobbies, sniping, trickshotting, 360noscopes, throwing knife/tomahawk across the map, funny moments with the boys/girls, being in a clan and dominating every lobby you matched into. But those days are gone, mindless running and shooting in silence is all that's left.  Only hardcore and diehard CoD fanboys play nowadays, mixed with those who play for nostalgia.If you're thinking about buying this, double think about it, triple think about it. Because at the rate that they're going, with new Call of Duty games each year or two years or whatever the heck it is, you've got to stop eventually because they're not going to stop.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

While the game itself is a classic, I highly DO NOT recommend buying or investing ANY money in this product as a system crash, any number of unrelated 3rd party software or thier own game crashing, allow the company to unilaterally deny you access to a game you purchased. And, this potentially contaminates any linked account or store (like Steam) you use, even other platforms.  Before buying, DO YOUR RESEARCH!!

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had. This wasn't just another year of Call of Duty, this was Modern Warfare 2, a title whose legacy is clearly far too heavy for MWII to raise.",84.4,277713,0,Recommended

So you keep going, and you keep ordering, and you keep trying it out in hopes that one day it'll taste the way it used to, but it never does.  The game looks like COD, but hardly feels or plays like the COD you used to know and you don't know why. No amount of updates and backpedalling can change the way that it just doesn't feel right.

Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue.

There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.",586.3,253318,0,Recommended

2023-03-05 00:00:00,"If you're here for the campaign, it's not worth 70USD If you're here for the nostalgia from playing vigorously a decade ago, you'll be disappointed If you're here because you think it's a good time to get back into Call of Duty, you're mistaken If you're here because you think that maybe, just maybe, this Call of Duty will be better compared to Vanguard or Modern Warfare (2019), trust me, it won't be.  I've played Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops, Black Ops II, Ghosts, Modern Warfare (2019), Vanguard, and this one, Modern Warfare 2 (2022)  The reason for me buying this one was because I'm a victim of the first paragraph in this review. I thought it would be better than the previous recent Call of Duty games, I thought it was time I returned, I thought there was hope that it would be better. I was WRONG.  With each new Call of Duty release, the UI (User Interface) looks more and more stupid, impractical, clunky, confusing, a menu within menu within menu slogfest. The gunsmith system is completely complex for no reason, but is advertised as innovative and easy. If you want a certain gun, you have to earn it by playing other guns, which require playing other guns, which require playing a starter gun. Bloody why?  The maps, don't get me started, there is no creativity behind the maps, for 70USD you're basically getting 4 maps but on rotation, and if new maps come out, guess what, it's a reskin of a map from an older cod title that came out a decade ago. Nuketown, Terminal, Dome, Shipment you know all these maps at some point in your ""CoD Career"" because they keep reusing them rather than giving us new fresh maps. And when they do give us fresh maps, it's completely horrible anyways.  Each Call of Duty game announces themselves with the slogan ""Going back to our roots"" or ""Boots on the ground"", if I had a dollar for every time I saw that, I'd be a billionaire. Truth is, there is no innovation, the franchise is undead (Dead but still alive when it shouldn't be). Battlefield 2042 flopped and Call of Duty got more popular but it seriously needs to die, because these studios, CEOs and big shot bastards are so comfortable with the easy money that we put in their pockets. They release lazy new games and call it innovation and we're all mindless sheep that still hold on to the hope that we can relive what it was like when we played Call of Duty growing up. For these past few years I had that hope, but NO MORE. I'm officially done with Call of Duty and Battlefield, it's just saddening that people will not realise that they're just being taken advantage of. I've realised it and I'm no longer going to support these half-baked games that haven't changed in forever, let the series die already and come up with something brand new.  There's a reason why the peak of Call of Duty games were in its infancy, for me personally, it was Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and 3, Black Ops 1 & 2, and Ghosts (I know people didn't like this one, but everything is subjective). What you fell in love with was the banter in voice chat lobbies, sniping, trickshotting, 360noscopes, throwing knife/tomahawk across the map, funny moments with the boys/girls, being in a clan and dominating every lobby you matched into. But those days are gone, mindless running and shooting in silence is all that's left.  Only hardcore and diehard CoD fanboys play nowadays, mixed with those who play for nostalgia.If you're thinking about buying this, double think about it, triple think about it.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content.

You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

2023-10-06 00:00:00,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release. Everything just feels recycled and it is like Cod is trying to be something it is not.,43.7,931935,0,Recommended

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended

December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended

I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).

2023-03-23 00:00:00,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare II is like ordering that one dish you always got at a restaurant you've been eating at for the past 18 years, only to start eating and realise that the recipe has changed. So you keep going, and you keep ordering, and you keep trying it out in hopes that one day it'll taste the way it used to, but it never does.  The game looks like COD, but hardly feels or plays like the COD you used to know and you don't know why. No amount of updates and backpedalling can change the way that it just doesn't feel right.

2023-08-05 00:00:00,"I would write a full review, but I'd rather not spend more time on this game than I already have. Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.  Thanks for coming to my review, I will leave comments open, because unlike Activision and Infinity Ward, I like feedback.",452.5,932107169,0,Recommended
2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would've had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you're considering buying this game, don't do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can't let $70 go to waste.

I admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging, but after investing over 200 hours each in MWII (2022) and MWIII (2023), the gameplay hasn't justified the time and money spent. There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.",586.3,253318,0,Recommended

2023-03-05 00:00:00,"If you're here for the campaign, it's not worth 70USD If you're here for the nostalgia from playing vigorously a decade ago, you'll be disappointed If you're here because you think it's a good time to get back into Call of Duty, you're mistaken If you're here because you think that maybe, just maybe, this Call of Duty will be better compared to Vanguard or Modern Warfare (2019), trust me, it won't be.  I've played Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops, Black Ops II, Ghosts, Modern Warfare (2019), Vanguard, and this one, Modern Warfare 2 (2022)  The reason for me buying this one was because I'm a victim of the first paragraph in this review. I thought it would be better than the previous recent Call of Duty games, I thought it was time I returned, I thought there was hope that it would be better. I was WRONG.  With each new Call of Duty release, the UI (User Interface) looks more and more stupid, impractical, clunky, confusing, a menu within menu within menu slogfest. The gunsmith system is completely complex for no reason, but is advertised as innovative and easy. If you want a certain gun, you have to earn it by playing other guns, which require playing other guns, which require playing a starter gun. Bloody why?  The maps, don't get me started, there is no creativity behind the maps, for 70USD you're basically getting 4 maps but on rotation, and if new maps come out, guess what, it's a reskin of a map from an older cod title that came out a decade ago. Nuketown, Terminal, Dome, Shipment you know all these maps at some point in your ""CoD Career"" because they keep reusing them rather than giving us new fresh maps. And when they do give us fresh maps, it's completely horrible anyways.  Each Call of Duty game announces themselves with the slogan ""Going back to our roots"" or ""Boots on the ground"", if I had a dollar for every time I saw that, I'd be a billionaire. Truth is, there is no innovation, the franchise is undead (Dead but still alive when it shouldn't be). Battlefield 2042 flopped and Call of Duty got more popular but it seriously needs to die, because these studios, CEOs and big shot bastards are so comfortable with the easy money that we put in their pockets. They release lazy new games and call it innovation and we're all mindless sheep that still hold on to the hope that we can relive what it was like when we played Call of Duty growing up. For these past few years I had that hope, but NO MORE. I'm officially done with Call of Duty and Battlefield, it's just saddening that people will not realise that they're just being taken advantage of. I've realised it and I'm no longer going to support these half-baked games that haven't changed in forever, let the series die already and come up with something brand new.  There's a reason why the peak of Call of Duty games were in its infancy, for me personally, it was Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and 3, Black Ops 1 & 2, and Ghosts (I know people didn't like this one, but everything is subjective). What you fell in love with was the banter in voice chat lobbies, sniping, trickshotting, 360noscopes, throwing knife/tomahawk across the map, funny moments with the boys/girls, being in a clan and dominating every lobby you matched into. But those days are gone, mindless running and shooting in silence is all that's left.  Only hardcore and diehard CoD fanboys play nowadays, mixed with those who play for nostalgia.If you're thinking about buying this, double think about it, triple think about it.

Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.  Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & combo?  Some TL:DR for you:  - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well   - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:  Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.  Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.  Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.  If you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption, you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra-low quality products you're getting from these companies.",939.7,5212037,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2024-06-11 00:00:00,"I bought this game. I am idiot and the last time i am going to be idiot. I have lost all hope/faith in any future COD franchise. Removed the game completely from my account. Don't even want to be reminded of the constant trap I keep falling into each year with this dogsht mediocre franchise.  Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium ♥♥♥♥ like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content. Progression is insanely slow and there is a premium version of the premium battlepass. Yes you read that correctly. You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.  BIG BIG BIG issue for me personally is too many ****ing menus, tabs, buttons to press things on the screen. You open the ****ing game and god forbid you press anything cause every button somehow opens a menu.. Who actually designed this UI???. Its like looking at a gas station bathroom wall of ADVERTISEMENTS of the very game you are playing at that moment. The UI is just absolutely horrendous whoever designed this UI just completely needs to be fired and never rehired for anything pertaining to ****ing UI.

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

2023-10-06 00:00:00,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had. This wasn't just another year of Call of Duty, this was Modern Warfare 2, a title whose legacy is clearly far too heavy for MWII to raise.",84.4,277713,0,Recommended

So you keep going, and you keep ordering, and you keep trying it out in hopes that one day it'll taste the way it used to, but it never does.  The game looks like COD, but hardly feels or plays like the COD you used to know and you don't know why. No amount of updates and backpedalling can change the way that it just doesn't feel right.

2023-08-05 00:00:00,"I would write a full review, but I'd rather not spend more time on this game than I already have. Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games. Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would've had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you're considering buying this game, don't do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can't let $70 go to waste.

There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.",586.3,253318,0,Recommended

2023-03-05 00:00:00,"If you're here for the campaign, it's not worth 70USD If you're here for the nostalgia from playing vigorously a decade ago, you'll be disappointed If you're here because you think it's a good time to get back into Call of Duty, you're mistaken If you're here because you think that maybe, just maybe, this Call of Duty will be better compared to Vanguard or Modern Warfare (2019), trust me, it won't be.  I've played Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops, Black Ops II, Ghosts, Modern Warfare (2019), Vanguard, and this one, Modern Warfare 2 (2022)  The reason for me buying this one was because I'm a victim of the first paragraph in this review. I thought it would be better than the previous recent Call of Duty games, I thought it was time I returned, I thought there was hope that it would be better. I was WRONG.  With each new Call of Duty release, the UI (User Interface) looks more and more stupid, impractical, clunky, confusing, a menu within menu within menu slogfest. The gunsmith system is completely complex for no reason, but is advertised as innovative and easy. If you want a certain gun, you have to earn it by playing other guns, which require playing other guns, which require playing a starter gun. Bloody why?  The maps, don't get me started, there is no creativity behind the maps, for 70USD you're basically getting 4 maps but on rotation, and if new maps come out, guess what, it's a reskin of a map from an older cod title that came out a decade ago. Nuketown, Terminal, Dome, Shipment you know all these maps at some point in your ""CoD Career"" because they keep reusing them rather than giving us new fresh maps. And when they do give us fresh maps, it's completely horrible anyways.  Each Call of Duty game announces themselves with the slogan ""Going back to our roots"" or ""Boots on the ground"", if I had a dollar for every time I saw that, I'd be a billionaire. Truth is, there is no innovation, the franchise is undead (Dead but still alive when it shouldn't be). Battlefield 2042 flopped and Call of Duty got more popular but it seriously needs to die, because these studios, CEOs and big shot bastards are so comfortable with the easy money that we put in their pockets. They release lazy new games and call it innovation and we're all mindless sheep that still hold on to the hope that we can relive what it was like when we played Call of Duty growing up. For these past few years I had that hope, but NO MORE. I'm officially done with Call of Duty and Battlefield, it's just saddening that people will not realise that they're just being taken advantage of. I've realised it and I'm no longer going to support these half-baked games that haven't changed in forever, let the series die already and come up with something brand new.  There's a reason why the peak of Call of Duty games were in its infancy, for me personally, it was Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and 3, Black Ops 1 & 2, and Ghosts (I know people didn't like this one, but everything is subjective). What you fell in love with was the banter in voice chat lobbies, sniping, trickshotting, 360noscopes, throwing knife/tomahawk across the map, funny moments with the boys/girls, being in a clan and dominating every lobby you matched into. But those days are gone, mindless running and shooting in silence is all that's left.  Only hardcore and diehard CoD fanboys play nowadays, mixed with those who play for nostalgia.If you're thinking about buying this, double think about it, triple think about it.

2022-12-23 00:00:00,"Not worth it. At all.  Ever since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You're simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.  Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & combo?  Some TL:DR for you:  - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well   - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:  Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.  Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.  Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.  If you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption, you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra-low quality products you're getting from these companies.",939.7,5212037,0,Recommended

If you love roller coasters, you’re in for a ride — because this game crashes more often than a demolition derby! Seriously, I’ve seen more stability in a Jenga tower built by toddlers than in this game.  Let’s talk about the gameplay. Oh wait, I can’t — because 80% of the time, you’re dealing with tryhards, cheaters and or babies. Some guys must have IV drips of energy drinks, because they play like their lives depend on it. One moment you’re respawning, the next you’re a target dummy for some sweat-soaked, basement-dwelling pro who’s clearly forgotten what sunlight looks like. The matchmaking is a tragedy for new players.  And don't get me started on the servers. Imagine trying to play a game while surfing the internet on a potato. Yup, that’s pretty much the experience. Lag spikes that could launch you to the moon, disconnects that make you question your Wi-Fi provider, and enough glitches to make you think you’re in a Matrix sequel.

2023-12-18 00:00:00,"𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬  At the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, I had little to zero intentions of buying the title for a price tag as oblivious as $70.00 (USD). Especially as someone who typically purchases Call of Duty titles for a specific game mode. In this case, I would have only bought it at first glance for the zombies mode. I decided to purchase the title once the game had gone on sale for $48.00.  𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐧  The campaign for this year's release was overall subpar in my opinion. The previous campaigns for the Call of Duty franchise had more elements of 'cinematic' game-play that truly made moments in the story more vibrant and intriguing to indulge into. In addition to the lack of meaningful storytelling, I would also have to agree when others and I myself say that the campaign was far too short, contributing to the feeling of being shortchanged for the value of the game with a retail price of $70.00.  𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫  Bits and pieces of nostalgia arose when I played the multiplayer modes of the title. The mechanics are spectacular, as you feel a sensation of: 'freedom,' being able to maneuver without the restrictions that were present in the previous title (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II). I do not concur with the reviews for down voting the game due to the presence of: 'Skilled Based Matchmaking' (SBMM). A lot of complaints I hear about video games having SBMM: ""I just want to relax and casually win games against people that aren't sweats,"" ""it's harder for me to get clips"" (whether it is a content creator (small time/big time) or someone that just wants to show off). Games like Call of Duty are supposed to be competitive in my opinion, especially being an First Person Shooter (FPS) title. In my point of view, if you are being placed against people that are just as good as you or even better, that should be a motivating factor for you to improve - be better? It simply seems as if everyone nowadays just want handouts for subpar performance/quality.  𝐙𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐞𝐬  My first impressions were thrilling. Everything was new, different levels of zones was in a way, intimidating. For a solid 10 - 15 matches, it was great to catch on to little things I did not know about the game mode until I learned bits and pieces of information from someone else or through exploring. Being able to level up your weapons in not only multiplayer, but also the zombies mode is a great selling point for me, as I never have to worry about the feeling of missing out (FOMO) and can simultaneously progress several portions of the game in one. However, it is important to note that at the current time of writing, you can only progress your weapon(s) 10 levels in one match before you are capped. I would definitely recommend this game mode to hardcore zombies fans of the franchise, as yes, I understand that it does not follow the traditional style of the franchises' zombies, but it is something new, and a good new, a refreshing experience for those who are looking for something different in zombies or burnt out on the previous franchises' zombies.  𝐌𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐬  I felt that it was a must that include this header for the topic of the game's mechanics and how they work, as a lot of the functionality may affect if a certain demographic of players would find this to be a deterrent from their purchase. As of writing, in Modern Warfare 3 (2023), there are a few changes in addition to how the overall aim and aiming down sights work. A lot of the information I will be referencing is contributed by my firsthand experience, as well as the points made from this video: . For whatever reason, the game is moving towards a more realistic, mil-sim-like game-play, which Call of Duty has never been known for. The weapons' reticles will never be centered when you aim down sights and will fly everywhere when you strafe, jump, prone, and move your input (mouse or right thumb-stick). I personally would not have much of a problem with this if it was not for the fact that controller players are not affected by this as much as mouse and keyboard players. This is the unbalanced aim assist that people reference when they exclaim how excruciatingly unfair it is to play against controller players, because I as a mouse and keyboard player myself, must skillfully compensate for the little variables and factors to make my aim perfect when on the other hand, a controller player has computer generated assistance to not have the same problems as a mouse and keyboard player does. The point I am trying to convey here is that it really seems like as the Call of Duty franchise progresses, there is a oblivious message being portrayed. That message being: ""more favoritism over controller players vs mouse and keyboard players.""  𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧  On top of the fact that the title was retail priced at $70.00, consumers may opt to purchase the 'Vault Edition' that came with the game for a total of $100.00+. I am truly failing to see how anyone producing this title believed that this would be satisfactory to any and all consumers of the franchise. It is clear that Activision no longer wishes to hide from the criticisms of many consumers for being a poorly managed company, built upon greed (added bonus: also being a company that has a history with tolerating sexual harassment, sexual assault, and inappropriate behavior in a workplace environment). Controller players once again have a oblivious advantage over mouse and keyboard players, and I may be biased because I am a mouse and keyboard player myself, but if you really stop to think about the amount of accommodations given to controller players, it does not add up to the overall equal playing field between the two inputs. I would not recommend this game simply because of the retail price of $70.00 because it does not meet the quality that deserves the preset amount. The campaign is subpar, everything within' the game looks to be easily copied and pasted over, and the greed displayed through heavy focus of micro-transactions instead of focusing on the quality and originality of the game. For a retail price of >$30.00, this would have been a reasonable purchase.",63.8,243835,0,Recommended

2022-11-01 00:00:00,"To start off apparently I am one of the lucky ones who have only had the occasional crash but after a weekend of extensive play and early access to the campaign I feel like I can write about this game. Now if you like MW2019 or onwards you'll probably like this game. But if you are a fan of the ""golden age"" of cod its time to stop buying these new CoD games, it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games. Take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one, they are pandering to us (the old guard of CoD haha) and will continue to push this disgusting micro-transaction/live service model of modern gaming. You probably don't need me to tell you it ain't like it used to be.  Campaign was fine, some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy. Multiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but TTK is fast, possibly fastest we have seen. Graphics are great! Feels like it runs better than previous new CoDs. Regardless its more of the same safe new CoD that you probably either already love or hate. If I could give this a score out of 10 I would probably say 7/10 but it would score higher if there weren't so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers, but loses points for predatory marketing practices. Why did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous CoDs? On the chance that you are new to CoD and have not purchased one before, don't start here, and avoid giving this company your money.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

2022-10-29 00:00:00,"Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for "" Unauthorized use of software"" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It's not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through.

Also it's not just me who encountered this issue, it's multiple people, they don't get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can't even get a refund so I'm stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn't care about their regular players, because there's over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I've heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it's ridiculous.

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

Accordingly, a table, database, or other dataset includes an “enemies attacks” entry, wherein a different value is separately assigned to each skill level and wherein each of the different values is associated with an accuracy of enemies attack, with higher skill levels having values associated therewith a greater accuracy of enemies attack and with lower skill levels having values associated therewith a lower accuracy of enemies attack  [0092] Once an assessment is made, the computer program that executes the gaming environment modifies elements of the session and/or gameplay parameters as the session is being created based on the aggregate skill level.

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had.

Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games. Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue.

I admit the gunplay is excellent and engaging, but after investing over 200 hours each in MWII (2022) and MWIII (2023), the gameplay hasn't justified the time and money spent. There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.",586.3,253318,0,Recommended

2023-03-05 00:00:00,"If you're here for the campaign, it's not worth 70USD If you're here for the nostalgia from playing vigorously a decade ago, you'll be disappointed If you're here because you think it's a good time to get back into Call of Duty, you're mistaken If you're here because you think that maybe, just maybe, this Call of Duty will be better compared to Vanguard or Modern Warfare (2019), trust me, it won't be.  I've played Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops, Black Ops II, Ghosts, Modern Warfare (2019), Vanguard, and this one, Modern Warfare 2 (2022)  The reason for me buying this one was because I'm a victim of the first paragraph in this review. I thought it would be better than the previous recent Call of Duty games, I thought it was time I returned, I thought there was hope that it would be better. I was WRONG.  With each new Call of Duty release, the UI (User Interface) looks more and more stupid, impractical, clunky, confusing, a menu within menu within menu slogfest. The gunsmith system is completely complex for no reason, but is advertised as innovative and easy. If you want a certain gun, you have to earn it by playing other guns, which require playing other guns, which require playing a starter gun. Bloody why?  The maps, don't get me started, there is no creativity behind the maps, for 70USD you're basically getting 4 maps but on rotation, and if new maps come out, guess what, it's a reskin of a map from an older cod title that came out a decade ago. Nuketown, Terminal, Dome, Shipment you know all these maps at some point in your ""CoD Career"" because they keep reusing them rather than giving us new fresh maps. And when they do give us fresh maps, it's completely horrible anyways.  Each Call of Duty game announces themselves with the slogan ""Going back to our roots"" or ""Boots on the ground"", if I had a dollar for every time I saw that, I'd be a billionaire. Truth is, there is no innovation, the franchise is undead (Dead but still alive when it shouldn't be). Battlefield 2042 flopped and Call of Duty got more popular but it seriously needs to die, because these studios, CEOs and big shot bastards are so comfortable with the easy money that we put in their pockets. They release lazy new games and call it innovation and we're all mindless sheep that still hold on to the hope that we can relive what it was like when we played Call of Duty growing up. For these past few years I had that hope, but NO MORE. I'm officially done with Call of Duty and Battlefield, it's just saddening that people will not realise that they're just being taken advantage of. I've realised it and I'm no longer going to support these half-baked games that haven't changed in forever, let the series die already and come up with something brand new.  There's a reason why the peak of Call of Duty games were in its infancy, for me personally, it was Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and 3, Black Ops 1 & 2, and Ghosts (I know people didn't like this one, but everything is subjective). What you fell in love with was the banter in voice chat lobbies, sniping, trickshotting, 360noscopes, throwing knife/tomahawk across the map, funny moments with the boys/girls, being in a clan and dominating every lobby you matched into. But those days are gone, mindless running and shooting in silence is all that's left.  Only hardcore and diehard CoD fanboys play nowadays, mixed with those who play for nostalgia.If you're thinking about buying this, double think about it, triple think about it. Because at the rate that they're going, with new Call of Duty games each year or two years or whatever the heck it is, you've got to stop eventually because they're not going to stop.

2022-12-23 00:00:00,"Not worth it. At all.  Ever since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You're simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.  Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & combo?  Some TL:DR for you:  - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well   - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:  Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.  Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.  Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.  If you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption, you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra-low quality products you're getting from these companies.",939.7,5212037,0,Recommended

If you love roller coasters, you’re in for a ride — because this game crashes more often than a demolition derby! Seriously, I’ve seen more stability in a Jenga tower built by toddlers than in this game.  Let’s talk about the gameplay. Oh wait, I can’t — because 80% of the time, you’re dealing with tryhards, cheaters and or babies. Some guys must have IV drips of energy drinks, because they play like their lives depend on it. One moment you’re respawning, the next you’re a target dummy for some sweat-soaked, basement-dwelling pro who’s clearly forgotten what sunlight looks like. The matchmaking is a tragedy for new players.  And don't get me started on the servers. Imagine trying to play a game while surfing the internet on a potato. Yup, that’s pretty much the experience. Lag spikes that could launch you to the moon, disconnects that make you question your Wi-Fi provider, and enough glitches to make you think you’re in a Matrix sequel.

2023-12-18 00:00:00,"𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬  At the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, I had little to zero intentions of buying the title for a price tag as oblivious as $70.00 (USD). Especially as someone who typically purchases Call of Duty titles for a specific game mode. In this case, I would have only bought it at first glance for the zombies mode. I decided to purchase the title once the game had gone on sale for $48.00.  𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐧  The campaign for this year's release was overall subpar in my opinion. The previous campaigns for the Call of Duty franchise had more elements of 'cinematic' game-play that truly made moments in the story more vibrant and intriguing to indulge into. In addition to the lack of meaningful storytelling, I would also have to agree when others and I myself say that the campaign was far too short, contributing to the feeling of being shortchanged for the value of the game with a retail price of $70.00.  𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫  Bits and pieces of nostalgia arose when I played the multiplayer modes of the title. The mechanics are spectacular, as you feel a sensation of: 'freedom,' being able to maneuver without the restrictions that were present in the previous title (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II). I do not concur with the reviews for down voting the game due to the presence of: 'Skilled Based Matchmaking' (SBMM). A lot of complaints I hear about video games having SBMM: ""I just want to relax and casually win games against people that aren't sweats,"" ""it's harder for me to get clips"" (whether it is a content creator (small time/big time) or someone that just wants to show off). Games like Call of Duty are supposed to be competitive in my opinion, especially being an First Person Shooter (FPS) title. In my point of view, if you are being placed against people that are just as good as you or even better, that should be a motivating factor for you to improve - be better? It simply seems as if everyone nowadays just want handouts for subpar performance/quality.  𝐙𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐞𝐬  My first impressions were thrilling. Everything was new, different levels of zones was in a way, intimidating. For a solid 10 - 15 matches, it was great to catch on to little things I did not know about the game mode until I learned bits and pieces of information from someone else or through exploring. Being able to level up your weapons in not only multiplayer, but also the zombies mode is a great selling point for me, as I never have to worry about the feeling of missing out (FOMO) and can simultaneously progress several portions of the game in one. However, it is important to note that at the current time of writing, you can only progress your weapon(s) 10 levels in one match before you are capped. I would definitely recommend this game mode to hardcore zombies fans of the franchise, as yes, I understand that it does not follow the traditional style of the franchises' zombies, but it is something new, and a good new, a refreshing experience for those who are looking for something different in zombies or burnt out on the previous franchises' zombies.  𝐌𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐬  I felt that it was a must that include this header for the topic of the game's mechanics and how they work, as a lot of the functionality may affect if a certain demographic of players would find this to be a deterrent from their purchase. As of writing, in Modern Warfare 3 (2023), there are a few changes in addition to how the overall aim and aiming down sights work. A lot of the information I will be referencing is contributed by my firsthand experience, as well as the points made from this video: . For whatever reason, the game is moving towards a more realistic, mil-sim-like game-play, which Call of Duty has never been known for. The weapons' reticles will never be centered when you aim down sights and will fly everywhere when you strafe, jump, prone, and move your input (mouse or right thumb-stick). I personally would not have much of a problem with this if it was not for the fact that controller players are not affected by this as much as mouse and keyboard players. This is the unbalanced aim assist that people reference when they exclaim how excruciatingly unfair it is to play against controller players, because I as a mouse and keyboard player myself, must skillfully compensate for the little variables and factors to make my aim perfect when on the other hand, a controller player has computer generated assistance to not have the same problems as a mouse and keyboard player does. The point I am trying to convey here is that it really seems like as the Call of Duty franchise progresses, there is a oblivious message being portrayed. That message being: ""more favoritism over controller players vs mouse and keyboard players.""  𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧  On top of the fact that the title was retail priced at $70.00, consumers may opt to purchase the 'Vault Edition' that came with the game for a total of $100.00+. I am truly failing to see how anyone producing this title believed that this would be satisfactory to any and all consumers of the franchise. It is clear that Activision no longer wishes to hide from the criticisms of many consumers for being a poorly managed company, built upon greed (added bonus: also being a company that has a history with tolerating sexual harassment, sexual assault, and inappropriate behavior in a workplace environment). Controller players once again have a oblivious advantage over mouse and keyboard players, and I may be biased because I am a mouse and keyboard player myself, but if you really stop to think about the amount of accommodations given to controller players, it does not add up to the overall equal playing field between the two inputs. I would not recommend this game simply because of the retail price of $70.00 because it does not meet the quality that deserves the preset amount. The campaign is subpar, everything within' the game looks to be easily copied and pasted over, and the greed displayed through heavy focus of micro-transactions instead of focusing on the quality and originality of the game. For a retail price of >$30.00, this would have been a reasonable purchase.",63.8,243835,0,Recommended

2022-11-01 00:00:00,"To start off apparently I am one of the lucky ones who have only had the occasional crash but after a weekend of extensive play and early access to the campaign I feel like I can write about this game. Now if you like MW2019 or onwards you'll probably like this game. But if you are a fan of the ""golden age"" of cod its time to stop buying these new CoD games, it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games. Take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one, they are pandering to us (the old guard of CoD haha) and will continue to push this disgusting micro-transaction/live service model of modern gaming. You probably don't need me to tell you it ain't like it used to be.  Campaign was fine, some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy. Multiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but TTK is fast, possibly fastest we have seen. Graphics are great! Feels like it runs better than previous new CoDs. Regardless its more of the same safe new CoD that you probably either already love or hate. If I could give this a score out of 10 I would probably say 7/10 but it would score higher if there weren't so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers, but loses points for predatory marketing practices. Why did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous CoDs? On the chance that you are new to CoD and have not purchased one before, don't start here, and avoid giving this company your money.  Probably gonna keep playing but that's only really because of Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 flopping hard, yay modern AAA gaming.",180.1,7752881,0,Recommended

Add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter into a mixing bowl and stir until well combined. -Transfer the crumb mixture into a 9-in / 23 cm deep-dish pie pan.

Pour the lemon filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. The lemon pie is done when the edges are set and only slightly jiggly in the centre. -Cool & refrigerate. Remove the pie from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate until firm for at least 3 hours before serving. -Garnish. Decorate the pie as desired.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

I've never cheated & I wouldn't even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.  11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it's the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can't even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven't played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I'm back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren't cheaters and didn't do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won't take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can't tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.",180.6,4234504376,0,Recommended

2023-02-11 00:00:00,"While clearly crafted with care in some respects, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game.  The reason behind that is what exactly you are buying: A pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours, and the crux of this review: a dilapidated, abandoned, mistreated, unfinished, barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience.  If you like Warzone, and plan on just playing Warzone, then just play Warzone. There is no reason at all to buy this game. They treat classic multiplayer like it's just Warzone weapon leveling simulator, and the problem with that is the perfectly good OTHER WZ weapon leveling simulator that is ALSO free: DMZ! If all you care about is leveling weapons for WZ, look up farming tutorials to use in DMZ.  If on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago, you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed.  I was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated, but honestly it's not worth any more time than I've already wasted writing this review. Just settle on this: the game feels like it has 4 maps, there is no 9v9 or 10v10, post launch ""seasonal"" content focuses 95% on WZ and DMZ (the free aspects of the game), lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention-based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up-dopamine down-dopamine cycle, etc.  I'm upset because the game had so much potential to be special. I hadn't played a CoD game since the first Black Ops before I got this game, and I was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support MW2019 got on launch and post launch. But after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2, it's clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point, FOUR MONTHS after launch. It's just sad, and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this.",147.6,9861777,0,Recommended

2024-06-11 00:00:00,"I bought this game. I am idiot and the last time i am going to be idiot. I have lost all hope/faith in any future COD franchise. Removed the game completely from my account. Don't even want to be reminded of the constant trap I keep falling into each year with this dogsht mediocre franchise.  Do not waste your money on this game and especially avoid the battlepass/premium ♥♥♥♥ like I did. Its predatory and all the premium content is just overpriced designs for operators I have no connection too while baiting another 100 mile battlepass grind that is just lackluster in sht content. Progression is insanely slow and there is a premium version of the premium battlepass. Yes you read that correctly. You get all the contexts of the premium battlepass that you JUST bought but an extra $20 and you will get the same contents but will have another color with particle affects of the same skin/design.  BIG BIG BIG issue for me personally is too many ****ing menus, tabs, buttons to press things on the screen. You open the ****ing game and god forbid you press anything cause every button somehow opens a menu.. Who actually designed this UI???. Its like looking at a gas station bathroom wall of ADVERTISEMENTS of the very game you are playing at that moment. The UI is just absolutely horrendous whoever designed this UI just completely needs to be fired and never rehired for anything pertaining to ****ing UI.

2023-07-29 00:00:00,"On the 28th of this month I received false bans on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as well as Call of Duty: Warzone. I have attempted to appeal the ban but, like many other players who have also been falsely banned, I have received an automated response from a bot rather than a human because it is clear they have zero interest in hearing innocent players that have been unjustly punished.  On record, I have a little over 1,000 hours on this game and have sunk quite a significant amount of money into it, so it would not make any sense for me to even consider hacking/cheating. It can be seen by my very average K/D ratio (about 1.13 or something along those lines) that there are no such hacks or cheats being used. At the time I received my initial shadowban, I had several legitimate programmes (Discord, Spotify, GeForce Experience and Logitech GHUB) running in the background. After doing a little research, taking a moment to recover from the shock that I had in fact received a permanent ban (a little under 48 hours of my initial shadowban), I came to find out that this has been a long standing issue and that these very legitimate and non-hack programmes have been triggering the subpar anti-cheat system put in place.  All attempts to contact Activision regarding this from myself and many other players facing the same issue have been ignored. Don't make the mistake of giving this company your money ever again, they do not care about you as a consumer.  Update: I am still banned as of 02/08/2023 and, as usual, all attempts to contact Activision have been in vain - including through BBB. Many others like myself are still being falsely banned due to running programmes like Logitech GHUB, GeForce Experiences, etc. Until Activision fixes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti-cheat or Microsoft settles their dispute with the CMA in the UK, there is little to no hope for people like myself being unbanned.  Update 2: I would highly recommend for any banned players that have spent even a single penny on this game (including the game itself) to try and charge the money back via your banks under 'denial of goods/service' as this is essentially what Activision is doing! I'm putting together a case to present to my bank about this and hopefully I'll get all (or at least most) of the money back. I will let you all know how that goes once it is over and done with.  Update 3: I have gotten a few questions regarding the chargeback case I have started. I have all the documents prepared and ready to present, however I am using every last resort option I have before going through with this as I do have a few legal connections I can pull on. I will update this post once more when everything is in order and let everyone know how things will proceed.

2023-10-06 00:00:00,Honestly Call Of Duty has fallen so hard from its glory days and simply now it is just a mess. Developers are only interested in making money rather then having a good Call Of Duty from the glory days. And yet they think by simply adding old guns and old maps it rectifies everything the game is missing. There's no longer any thought or reason into the map designs or spawning. And this is not me saying all of this on a the back of a loss. I find it so difficult to actually get into Call Of Duty anymore. Tried every mode and forcing myself to play it but it is simply just not enjoyable anymore. The only reason cod is still alive is because Battlefield flopped on the last release.

2023-04-13 00:00:00,"<MWII Review> (This is mainly a review of the Multiplayer, and a mention of the Campaign. I have not played Warzone past the bare minimum) Man, I really wanted to love this one. I've been an avid Call of Duty player since 2013, and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series. But this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all. All of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high, and given it is a sequel to one of the best COD games, Modern Warfare (2019), I was expecting a lot from this release. Then the game released. I don't know where to start. To begin, the UI is terrible. Instead of the clean and concise menus of MW(2019) where all of the option can be clearly seen, this game opts for a side-scrolling mess. I guess the developers didn't get the memo that literally no other games are doing this, or chose to ignore it to become ""different"". Either way it sucks. This menu style isn't just for the main menu, oh no! This is done for the Class-Creation menus as well, and for the Class selection at the start of every game. Its messy and constrictive. The weapons and equipment range from ""you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this"" to ""you'd be stupid not to use it"". A good example of the former is the Tactical Camera ""Field Upgrade"" as the game calls it. The worse piece of equipment from Black Ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game. It is incredibly situational, such as watching an angle while you camp another, or watch as a Domination Flag gets captured because your teammates won't play the objective. You could be using any other Field Upgrade, like Dead Silence, which silences your footsteps, but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used. The weapon progression system is bad too. This game introduces the idea of weapon platforms, in which similar weapons, such as the AK-47 and the AK-74u, can have interchangeable components, meaning you can switch from Assault Rifle to Sub-Machine Gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch. This would be a good idea, except it doesn't take all that long to do a reconfigure, and the majority of the time, you will be switching gun to level it up, which means none of the components will carry over. In addition some guns are locked behind another gun's level progression, rather than player level. I could go on, but I wanted to talk about his games main issue: Skill-Based Matchmaking. If you didn't know, this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby. This means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you. That's the idea anyway, in execution, its much worse. This type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups: smurfs, meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players, and sweaty try-hards, who seem to think their life is on the line in every match, thus play like they have severe ADHD. If you have a good match, well done, your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you've ever seen. This is bad for an avid player like myself, but its downright unplayable for the more casual players: the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day, or the new players who have never played a COD game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play. Relating to this, skill-based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you're level 300 will have an awful time. My next point of contention is the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters. It doesn't work. Or rather its highly inconsistent. The player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there; The player with the Ghost perk active before its timer runs out; The player who just blatantly doesn't take damage when you shoot him. And don't bother expecting Activision or Infinity Ward to read your reports, because they could not care less! And that really the best way to describe this game, the developers simply do not care. Why bother with the multiplayer when Warzone Battle Royale is such a cash cow. To add to this, if it saves money on development, then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names. That's right, the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn't pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game! That may look like an MP5 or an AK, but its not, just trust me dude. Its even more of a joke because they didn't do this for MW(2019)! I could actually go on all day about even more gripes I have, such as the useless game modes no-one plays, the lacklustre Co-Op missions, the horribly boring PVE Raids, or the actual false advertising in their content promises, but this review is very very long. There are positives, if you can believe it. The campaign is quite good, if a little unmemorable; the gun play is actually quite good, most are fun to fire, and the quick-draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments, a la the John Wick 2 Catacombs scene. The graphics are awesome, little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it. Its just a damn shame about the rest of it. And I think we can all agree, its time to let the Battle Royale genre die.",575.0,5661238,0,Recommended

2022-11-10 00:00:00,"Edit (Part 1/2):    As the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.  However, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.  I will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.  I truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.  There is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.  I'm praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does't rain too much he'll down on the game when the DLC is to release.    Edit (Part 2/2):    After putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don't get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.    The bad:    Skill Based Match Making - Since I hadn't played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.  Co-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy's Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.  The maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don't feel like Call of Duty maps. I don't know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don't really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty's maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There's just no middle ground.  Game modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.  Gunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.  UI - I'm not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.  Perks - I don't mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.    Conclusion:    There are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don't put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did.  These other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they'll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.  I'm not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don't, it wouldn't be a surprise at all.  There has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it's not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty's on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.  However, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.    (You may find my original review below for the lols)    While Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn't mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.  As I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.  I felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.  The main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year.  I feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.  Well... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing ""even better Call of Duty's"" and ""bringing the franchise to new heights""  So here is my message to the franchise for this decision:  ♥♥♥♥ you.  And to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.",691.3,5048426352,0,Recommended
2023-11-09 00:00:00,"December 18 update: I have failed, I have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while MW3 was 30% off.  December 6 update for MW3 Season 1: so now Warzone is disconnected from being standalone/linked to MW2 and now accessible from the COD HQ so no more application instance jumping for that. DMZ is still confused, one place it says it's part of Warzone, the next is says it's part of MW2, but once you are in DMZ, the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to COD HQ. Bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play MW2 which is completely unaceptable. There no reason we can't have access to all within COD HQ for MW3, WZ, DMZ & MW2. I'll still play it, but I'm not buying MW3 unless they bring foward a new Raid and actual improvement to UI user experience.  Original review: The recent update bring a subpar UI to something even worse. You are forced into MW3 COD HQ before going anywhere (even if you haven't bought it) and which is no longer integrated with MW2 or Warzone. So if you select one or the other, it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software. Want to switch from MW2 to Warzone for some DMZ or battle royale? You have to go back to MW3 COD HQ which means, MW2 shutdown, open MW3, shut down, open Warzone/DMZ. When I tried to get out of DMZ, it didn't even go back to Warzone, instead doing the shutdown/reopen cycle.  This is unaceptable and this is a step back.",730.7,19744,0,Recommended
2023-04-27 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Whatever you think about the MW19 vs MWII arguments, forget it for a minute. MWII is a brazen display of the lowest amount of effort with the highest emphasis on ROI with P2W bundles, a premium battlepass that has another premium battlepass layered on top of it (purchased separately) and dripfed content to artificially stretch out player engagement and retention. I have taken multiple breaks from the game only to return to a functionally similar title with negligible changes to movement & gunplay - maps re-released from the beta marketed as new content, re-re-re-re-re-released maps from years prior (Season 3 marks Dome's 6th appearances in CoD titles since MW3).  Make no mistake, this is all just for their bottom line. There is no care in this title, and there never will be. This should have been a slam dunk for Infinity Ward, coming off of the milquetoast Vanguard into a welcome change has turned into a live service nightmare, devoid completely of the compassion of it's brother of same name had. This wasn't just another year of Call of Duty, this was Modern Warfare 2, a title whose legacy is clearly far too heavy for MWII to raise.",84.4,277713,0,Recommended

So you keep going, and you keep ordering, and you keep trying it out in hopes that one day it'll taste the way it used to, but it never does.  The game looks like COD, but hardly feels or plays like the COD you used to know and you don't know why. No amount of updates and backpedalling can change the way that it just doesn't feel right.

2023-08-05 00:00:00,"I would write a full review, but I'd rather not spend more time on this game than I already have. Anyways, here's a list of fun facts: 1) COD has fallen from grace. 2) Activision is a ♥♥♥♥ company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves. 3) Bobby Kotick looks like the word ""Burgundy"" and I'd rather look at my own unshaven ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after I've just taken a ♥♥♥♥. 4) They are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just ""Call of Duty"" for ""convenience purposes"" or whatever the hell, but actually they're doing it so that way they can hide the ""Mixed"" and ""Negative"" reviews in later releases. 5) ALL of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like ♥♥♥♥. 6) They really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with 'The Boys' but it was actually the most boring thing ever, and they couldn't even get Antony Starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some Z-list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest. 7) Nicki Minaj is a sex offender, music sucks too. 8) 21 Savage is a felon, music sucks too. 9) Re-releasing Snoop Dogg as another overpriced ♥♥♥♥ bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence. Buying it means you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. 10) Infinity Ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped, they'll continue to lie to you until they pay for it. 11) I've had more fun writing this review than I have in the 362 hours I've spent playing this game. 12) I recently went back and played Call of Duty: Vanguard and had more fun playing that than I did this; plus the UI didn't make me want to punch an infant. 13) Treyarch has been carrying this COD as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community (it's true, they are in charge of Ranked Play and have responded to the community more than Activision has regarding their lawsuits) 14) I am uninstalling this heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥, and if they actually make THIS the ""Main hub for future COD titles"" including Treyarch's next masterpiece, they will never see my bank card again. 15) This is the last fun fact, just like this is the last time COD will ever reach over 80k players.

2023-01-13 00:00:00,"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.  Been playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.  Since this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the TL;DR Pros: Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc. Weapon tuning                                 And the list goes on.      Kinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.     They called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.  Bots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.  There is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.     Oh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.  This game is really because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.  TTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk.  You thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.  IW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their logic.         Much more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.  This game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.","1,943.4",6482830,0,Recommended

2022-10-28 00:00:00,"Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Call of Duty Modern Warfare II Review This part of the review is only about the Singleplayer For more information about the MP side, check comments down below.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoDMW2) is a really short game with little plot, summarizing its story would be basically spoiling it… so I’m going to be really vague about it: CoDMW2 is about a group of soldiers and their adventures and misadventures fighting terrorist and narcos. There is a bit more to this but that is basically it.  This is basically a meme but I still have to tell you that CoDMW2 is essentially more of the same of what other CoDs offer. So if you don’t like CoD games this game probably won't change your mind about the franchise. CoDMW2 in some aspects feels like a game from the late 2000’s.  Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it:  What is it exactly that you do in the game?  It’s a CoD game… so you will spend most of your time shooting enemy soldiers. This time around, CoDMW2 offers you several new side missions like sniping, sneaking around using crafting items in a gameplay loop similar to a very basic immersive sim and shooting enemies on the ground from an airplane. This time around, CoDMW2 decided to make the combat more slow and methodical… Meaning? you will have to use a lot of cover and spend more bullets killing armored enemies.                                 It’s a game that I really wanted to like but at the end it’s another game in the CoD franchise. Let me elaborate. First there is the issue that you have to have an “Activision account” to play the game. Then you have to agree 2 times to sell your soul to Activision. THEN you have to decline buying the $100 edition… THEN you have to connect to the server and then you can start playing the game. And, besides agreeing to the ToS, you will have to do that every time that you launch the game… unless the game updates then you will have to do it all again.  Then there is the issue of armored enemies… I have to tell you, in later parts of the game when you are low on ammunition and the game decides to send waves of them to kill you… they aren’t fun to fight. There is a part that almost made me rage quit when you lose all your gear, have to stealthily kill some enemies and gather some supplies and out of nowhere… The game decides that it’s time for you to kill hordes of armored enemies… that wasn’t fun at all.  All is not bad in CoDMW2… there are missions that are fun… I’m not going to spoil anything to you, but there is a chase mission that is really fun… but it kind of overstays its welcome. The sniping missions are fun too, they give you a lot of options and side objectives and if you are caught you don’t insta-fail them. Most of the stealth missions are somewhat interesting because they allow you to be creative and outsmart the enemies. Too bad the game’s AIs are not that great, but the stealth mechanics and the whole crafting system associated with this part of the game is quite decent.                                 For $70 this is a hard sale for me. The campaign has great moments, but also a lot of frustrating and annoying moments. Even with all the annoying bits that CoDMW2 has, I somewhat liked it. I didn’t like it for the story but rather because of how fun the gunplay is. If you are only planning to play this game for the campaign, wait for a sale.  Rating: 7/10 It’s buggy expensive but overall is just decent.","4,241.4",87212,0,Recommended

2022-10-31 00:00:00,"Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.  The UI is still bad but my game functions, it's still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don't care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I'm choosing when it's either on the gun or just a playlist.  MTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it's still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.  DMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.  Warzone is Warzone lol.  Spec Ops does get updated, and that's good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There's a blueprint tied to it I haven't grinded for, but there's a ""weekly"" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven't gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.  Core MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you'll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision's attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the ""de facto"" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don't know how to put my finger on it but it's a good 'turn the brain off' game, but it's not something I'd consider amazing?  Campaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there's not a spectacular amount that's memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It's a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a 'tutorial' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there's going to be a third game and they'll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.  Do I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it's on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it's slower than most 'modern' CoDs (2019~Vanguard).  I like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It's alright. I wouldn't switch to a full recommend because it's still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.  tl;dr  its mid but its brain popcorn. it's just brain popcorn that's too expensive.  I also can't switch the thumb or it's going to wipe ratings, and I'm not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.",990.5,152463184,0,Recommended

2022-11-15 00:00:00,"You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards ""casuals"", nor ""the OGs"" of the COD community  Before I get into the title and explain why you shouldn't bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it's kind, I'm going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don't.  What I like I) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn't on the AK, when converting it to 5.45. II) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn't worth it since it didn't make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should've done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy's spawn, not punished for it.  What I dislike I) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later. •Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing. •Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the ""immersion"" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly. •The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It's like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a ""brand new game"". •Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect. •The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter's shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of ""realism"" to normies who think they've become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive. •Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll. II) You might be thinking ""Woah, that's a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn't have messed up worse this time?"". If that's what's on your mind, you'd be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves. •The UI is some of the worse I've ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn't work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it'd be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is? •There is this new ""ledge hang"" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It's also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you. •On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn't like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it's not even remotely the case.    Of course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The ""OGs"" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the ""red dots"" on the minimap and the perk ""dead silence"", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.   Again, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don't have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new ""receiver"" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.     Thank you for reading my review. I don't do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.",47.0,226845,0,Recommended

All it does is give people ammunition to hate cod and frustrate people who bought and installed the games. Why do they continue to do this?  Frankly it was warzone that ruined COD and drove the desire for the launcher in the first place. Warzone exists because of Fortnite.

2023-01-02 00:00:00,"Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....  Here is what I have experienced so far:  1. If you're good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big ""HOW?""  2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn't register so you have to relaunch the game.  3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).  4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).  5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don't play any different here.  Overall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would've had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you're considering buying this game, don't do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can't let $70 go to waste.

There are numerous reasons to avoid this mess: SBMM, exorbitantly priced skin bundles for a game that already costed you 70 dollars or more, bloated game size because of paid cosmetics, and bugs/glitches that haven't been addressed since the games' releases (both MW2 and MW3). Not to mention the neglect of side modes like DMZ/MWZ, among other issues. I could go on and mention other stuff, such as how MWIII was initially intended to be a DLC/Expansion for MWII before they opted to launch it as a standalone game, seemingly to leech off more money from their dumbass consumer base or how MWIII single-player campaign being the worst one from the entire series, mostly because it was obviously rushed so they could release this slop quickly but everyone already knows this and I don't wanna waste more of my time writting about this garbage.",586.3,253318,0,Recommended

2023-03-05 00:00:00,"If you're here for the campaign, it's not worth 70USD If you're here for the nostalgia from playing vigorously a decade ago, you'll be disappointed If you're here because you think it's a good time to get back into Call of Duty, you're mistaken If you're here because you think that maybe, just maybe, this Call of Duty will be better compared to Vanguard or Modern Warfare (2019), trust me, it won't be.  I've played Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops, Black Ops II, Ghosts, Modern Warfare (2019), Vanguard, and this one, Modern Warfare 2 (2022)  The reason for me buying this one was because I'm a victim of the first paragraph in this review. I thought it would be better than the previous recent Call of Duty games, I thought it was time I returned, I thought there was hope that it would be better. I was WRONG.  With each new Call of Duty release, the UI (User Interface) looks more and more stupid, impractical, clunky, confusing, a menu within menu within menu slogfest. The gunsmith system is completely complex for no reason, but is advertised as innovative and easy. If you want a certain gun, you have to earn it by playing other guns, which require playing other guns, which require playing a starter gun. Bloody why?  The maps, don't get me started, there is no creativity behind the maps, for 70USD you're basically getting 4 maps but on rotation, and if new maps come out, guess what, it's a reskin of a map from an older cod title that came out a decade ago. Nuketown, Terminal, Dome, Shipment you know all these maps at some point in your ""CoD Career"" because they keep reusing them rather than giving us new fresh maps. And when they do give us fresh maps, it's completely horrible anyways.  Each Call of Duty game announces themselves with the slogan ""Going back to our roots"" or ""Boots on the ground"", if I had a dollar for every time I saw that, I'd be a billionaire. Truth is, there is no innovation, the franchise is undead (Dead but still alive when it shouldn't be). Battlefield 2042 flopped and Call of Duty got more popular but it seriously needs to die, because these studios, CEOs and big shot bastards are so comfortable with the easy money that we put in their pockets. They release lazy new games and call it innovation and we're all mindless sheep that still hold on to the hope that we can relive what it was like when we played Call of Duty growing up. For these past few years I had that hope, but NO MORE. I'm officially done with Call of Duty and Battlefield, it's just saddening that people will not realise that they're just being taken advantage of. I've realised it and I'm no longer going to support these half-baked games that haven't changed in forever, let the series die already and come up with something brand new.  There's a reason why the peak of Call of Duty games were in its infancy, for me personally, it was Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and 3, Black Ops 1 & 2, and Ghosts (I know people didn't like this one, but everything is subjective). What you fell in love with was the banter in voice chat lobbies, sniping, trickshotting, 360noscopes, throwing knife/tomahawk across the map, funny moments with the boys/girls, being in a clan and dominating every lobby you matched into. But those days are gone, mindless running and shooting in silence is all that's left.  Only hardcore and diehard CoD fanboys play nowadays, mixed with those who play for nostalgia.If you're thinking about buying this, double think about it, triple think about it.

2022-12-23 00:00:00,"Not worth it. At all.  Ever since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You're simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.  Skill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I'm playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it's the same scenario since the game got released.  Also, if there is a ""ranked"" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn't the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?  Extra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I'm getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?  For some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don't know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can't emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can't bother calling it aim assist anymore, it's Aimbot. For real it's aimbot. You'll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you're slightly next to their crosshair, you're done. They don't even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there's no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.  I get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they're using just their thumbs to aim, but I don't want to be a part of this. I don't want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he'll be able to get kills. It's simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it's not possible? Isn't the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & combo?  Some TL:DR for you:  - Good Gunplay - Good Animations - Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons - Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock - AMD's FSR works pretty well   - SBMM - No Crossplay opt-out choice - Inconsistent footsteps & audio - No Stopping Power as a perk - No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk - Matches feel rigged  *Edit 18/08/2024*  So after many extra hours and upon reaching max level, the more time I spent playing this, the more it reinforced what I and many others have already said before.  To sum it up, I'll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience I've had with this game this one year and a half:  Me and one of my friends are playing Prisoner Rescue for a two hour session in the night. First hour goes fine, we're both making good scores and we have a 7 game win-streak, we're seeing some new players and some old, matches play fine with no problem, nothing out of the ordinary happening.  Now the second hour we're playing, we're starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game. We're getting teammates that are acting like they're playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives, while the enemy team is either a 4 stack, a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend. It's a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over.  Our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual, hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend, enemy weapons get such a fast TTK it feels like a single-frame death, meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone. I was using G3A3 and my friend was using SCAR-H, and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a Battle-Rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range. Also packet loss (white color) and packet burst (orange color) was appearing every few seconds for both of us, but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session. And of course let's not forget, the enemies we're fighting have below 10 ping, meanwhile my friend is at 40 and I'm at 60.  The game's algorithm is literally nerfing you in real time, sacrificing your experience in order to make the opponent's better. It's trying really hard to keep you as close to 1 K/D and 1 W/L as possible, with whatever means it has available. Activision is known to take the fun out of their games the moment you show them you're above average and can actually play good.  People who defend this and act as if me or my friend are the problem, they're the same people getting gaslighted by the same algorithm they protect, because they're so garbage they end up playing on protected brackets of matchmaking in order to spend more money for skins.  If you still think this franchise has a chance for redemption, you are another fool of consumerism and you deserve every ultra-low quality products you're getting from these companies.",939.7,5212037,0,Recommended

If you love roller coasters, you’re in for a ride — because this game crashes more often than a demolition derby! Seriously, I’ve seen more stability in a Jenga tower built by toddlers than in this game.  Let’s talk about the gameplay. Oh wait, I can’t — because 80% of the time, you’re dealing with tryhards, cheaters and or babies. Some guys must have IV drips of energy drinks, because they play like their lives depend on it. One moment you’re respawning, the next you’re a target dummy for some sweat-soaked, basement-dwelling pro who’s clearly forgotten what sunlight looks like. The matchmaking is a tragedy for new players.  And don't get me started on the servers. Imagine trying to play a game while surfing the internet on a potato. Yup, that’s pretty much the experience. Lag spikes that could launch you to the moon, disconnects that make you question your Wi-Fi provider, and enough glitches to make you think you’re in a Matrix sequel.  So, if you enjoy pulling your hair out, yelling at your screen, and generally questioning your life choices, this is the game for you!

2023-12-18 00:00:00,"𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬  At the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, I had little to zero intentions of buying the title for a price tag as oblivious as $70.00 (USD). Especially as someone who typically purchases Call of Duty titles for a specific game mode. In this case, I would have only bought it at first glance for the zombies mode. I decided to purchase the title once the game had gone on sale for $48.00.  𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐧  The campaign for this year's release was overall subpar in my opinion. The previous campaigns for the Call of Duty franchise had more elements of 'cinematic' game-play that truly made moments in the story more vibrant and intriguing to indulge into. In addition to the lack of meaningful storytelling, I would also have to agree when others and I myself say that the campaign was far too short, contributing to the feeling of being shortchanged for the value of the game with a retail price of $70.00.  𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫  Bits and pieces of nostalgia arose when I played the multiplayer modes of the title. The mechanics are spectacular, as you feel a sensation of: 'freedom,' being able to maneuver without the restrictions that were present in the previous title (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II). I do not concur with the reviews for down voting the game due to the presence of: 'Skilled Based Matchmaking' (SBMM). A lot of complaints I hear about video games having SBMM: ""I just want to relax and casually win games against people that aren't sweats,"" ""it's harder for me to get clips"" (whether it is a content creator (small time/big time) or someone that just wants to show off). Games like Call of Duty are supposed to be competitive in my opinion, especially being an First Person Shooter (FPS) title. In my point of view, if you are being placed against people that are just as good as you or even better, that should be a motivating factor for you to improve - be better? It simply seems as if everyone nowadays just want handouts for subpar performance/quality.  𝐙𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐞𝐬  My first impressions were thrilling. Everything was new, different levels of zones was in a way, intimidating. For a solid 10 - 15 matches, it was great to catch on to little things I did not know about the game mode until I learned bits and pieces of information from someone else or through exploring. Being able to level up your weapons in not only multiplayer, but also the zombies mode is a great selling point for me, as I never have to worry about the feeling of missing out (FOMO) and can simultaneously progress several portions of the game in one. However, it is important to note that at the current time of writing, you can only progress your weapon(s) 10 levels in one match before you are capped. I would definitely recommend this game mode to hardcore zombies fans of the franchise, as yes, I understand that it does not follow the traditional style of the franchises' zombies, but it is something new, and a good new, a refreshing experience for those who are looking for something different in zombies or burnt out on the previous franchises' zombies.  𝐌𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐬  I felt that it was a must that include this header for the topic of the game's mechanics and how they work, as a lot of the functionality may affect if a certain demographic of players would find this to be a deterrent from their purchase. As of writing, in Modern Warfare 3 (2023), there are a few changes in addition to how the overall aim and aiming down sights work. A lot of the information I will be referencing is contributed by my firsthand experience, as well as the points made from this video: . For whatever reason, the game is moving towards a more realistic, mil-sim-like game-play, which Call of Duty has never been known for. The weapons' reticles will never be centered when you aim down sights and will fly everywhere when you strafe, jump, prone, and move your input (mouse or right thumb-stick). I personally would not have much of a problem with this if it was not for the fact that controller players are not affected by this as much as mouse and keyboard players. This is the unbalanced aim assist that people reference when they exclaim how excruciatingly unfair it is to play against controller players, because I as a mouse and keyboard player myself, must skillfully compensate for the little variables and factors to make my aim perfect when on the other hand, a controller player has computer generated assistance to not have the same problems as a mouse and keyboard player does. The point I am trying to convey here is that it really seems like as the Call of Duty franchise progresses, there is a oblivious message being portrayed. That message being: ""more favoritism over controller players vs mouse and keyboard players.""  𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧  On top of the fact that the title was retail priced at $70.00, consumers may opt to purchase the 'Vault Edition' that came with the game for a total of $100.00+. I am truly failing to see how anyone producing this title believed that this would be satisfactory to any and all consumers of the franchise. It is clear that Activision no longer wishes to hide from the criticisms of many consumers for being a poorly managed company, built upon greed (added bonus: also being a company that has a history with tolerating sexual harassment, sexual assault, and inappropriate behavior in a workplace environment). Controller players once again have a oblivious advantage over mouse and keyboard players, and I may be biased because I am a mouse and keyboard player myself, but if you really stop to think about the amount of accommodations given to controller players, it does not add up to the overall equal playing field between the two inputs. I would not recommend this game simply because of the retail price of $70.00 because it does not meet the quality that deserves the preset amount. The campaign is subpar, everything within' the game looks to be easily copied and pasted over, and the greed displayed through heavy focus of micro-transactions instead of focusing on the quality and originality of the game. For a retail price of >$30.00, this would have been a reasonable purchase.",63.8,243835,0,Recommended

2022-11-01 00:00:00,"To start off apparently I am one of the lucky ones who have only had the occasional crash but after a weekend of extensive play and early access to the campaign I feel like I can write about this game. Now if you like MW2019 or onwards you'll probably like this game. But if you are a fan of the ""golden age"" of cod its time to stop buying these new CoD games, it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games. Take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one, they are pandering to us (the old guard of CoD haha) and will continue to push this disgusting micro-transaction/live service model of modern gaming. You probably don't need me to tell you it ain't like it used to be.  Campaign was fine, some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy. Multiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but TTK is fast, possibly fastest we have seen. Graphics are great! Feels like it runs better than previous new CoDs. Regardless its more of the same safe new CoD that you probably either already love or hate. If I could give this a score out of 10 I would probably say 7/10 but it would score higher if there weren't so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers, but loses points for predatory marketing practices. Why did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous CoDs? On the chance that you are new to CoD and have not purchased one before, don't start here, and avoid giving this company your money.
