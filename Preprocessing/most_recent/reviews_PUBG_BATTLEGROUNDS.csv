2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

2021-04-04 00:00:00,"After nearly 3000 hours of playing time, im sorry to report, that this game development is going into the completly wrong direction. - Developers are not listening to loyal players - Features like map selection have been removed - Too many strange maps - who needs Karakin or Paramo? If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.  This game is utterly brilliant from its idea - Erangel is like the perfect BR map, weapon control is brilliant, but the way how PUBG is developing the game is just blatant and careless.

Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel. Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.  When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!  It really feels like the Devs completely lost the roadmap and made the rest up as they went along, stealing other games recipes and jumbling it up into one mess.

2023-08-27 00:00:00,"I have over 6 thousand hours in this game, so I'd have some ground to stand on when it comes to posting an honest review of this game:  It's a fun game, when you are playing with the right people and don't really care too much about actual game-play. But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel. Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.  When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"".

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"".

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire. Send help.","1,326.7",132065125,0,Recommended
2020-01-17 00:00:00,"After 2 years and 2,200 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended
2020-04-26 00:00:00,"3 years and 3,500 hours of gameplay and this game is still a joke. Very clunky, glitches, bugs, FPS drops, desync, you name it! Still, I can live with all of the above...  One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.  I have no faith in what the developers say or promise anymore. Utterly disappointed.","6,182.9",709774,0,Recommended

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"".

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.

Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review.

If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended
2020-04-26 00:00:00,"3 years and 3,500 hours of gameplay and this game is still a joke. Very clunky, glitches, bugs, FPS drops, desync, you name it! Still, I can live with all of the above...  One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.  I have no faith in what the developers say or promise anymore. Utterly disappointed.","6,182.9",709774,0,Recommended

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues.

It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay.

Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended
2022-03-05 00:00:00,"PUBG is a game that I have played almost religiously since the beta. I loved this game a lot, but I noticed as time went on, the game's performance declined. The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5.

What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended

It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review.

2020-01-17 00:00:00,"After 2 years and 2,200 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community.

Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.

2022-03-05 00:00:00,"PUBG is a game that I have played almost religiously since the beta. I loved this game a lot, but I noticed as time went on, the game's performance declined. The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing.

Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2021-06-13 00:00:00,"POOR MANAGEMENT OF THIS GAME. HACKS ARE RIFE NOW, so I cannot recommend this game to anyone new. As a level 1, you will play against level 500 players. You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.

Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out.

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.

Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

2024-02-28 00:00:00,"After investing over 2500 hours into the game and purchased the game before it became free, I regret to express my inability to recommend it to prospective players. The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.  Shame..  ------   Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB ""FIX PUBG"" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.  ""FIX PUBG"" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game. You can find the roadmap  ------  There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.  ------   Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...  Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!  Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!  Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!  ----------  But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:  + Engaging battle royale mode + Incredibly fun with friends + 3 large scale maps + A variety of guns and customization + Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant  - Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however) - Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups - Server issues, desync and rubberbanding - Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key) - Inferior Event Pass design to other games - Ignorant Map Playlist design  - High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me. - The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)  ---------  Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well.

The ""pay to look good"" cosmetic reworks only really benefit people who want to spend money on a game that loses more and more of its player base everyday.

I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!","1,516.6",5202342,0,Recommended

2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.

You may get to the top 10, only to spectate blatant hacking like, snapping to target, position pinpointing on the map and in particular through terrain, rapid fire hacks, looting hacks, speed hacks, teaming, network hacks that render you motionless and unable to defend...the list goes on....(as of 13/06/2021). Don't waste your time or money, as management hardly act on your reporting. When they do act, they issue a 24 hour ban, so they don't take your complaints seriously. You have to wait longer to get into games now, and they fill the play field with bots to make up numbers as serious gamer's are leaving in droves. It's terribly disappointing, as it seemed like it had potential until the developers gave up on it and now only micro manage it's major issues. Wait for a better Battle Royal to hit the market where the company actually reward their original and loyal fan base and remove the cheats.","1,282.6",7682435,0,Recommended
2020-01-22 00:00:00,"PUBG was a great game. The hacking in this game is still a huge problem and has made most of the people i played it with to give up on the game and move onto something else. It was great fun playing with friends, great maps and gameplay. But i feel like those days have passed and until the developers find a way to stop the hacking all together theres no point playing the game. Watching your deathcam and seeing hackers lock on and know exactly where you are when they shouldn't nearly every match you play takes it toll. I hope that one day its fixed but its been a problem for such a long time now that i think its unlikely to ever happen. Sucks because everytime i see an update, a new map or new guns im always keen to give it another go but the hackers just ruin the experience everytime.","1,987.2",280110,0,Recommended
2019-11-10 00:00:00,"When this game works, it's fantastic. One of the best, most compelling games I've ever played. But these days almost every round you play is affected by some sort of issue. Server desync, physics bugs, randomly impassable terrain and fps spikes are a regular occurrence, but most egregious of all are the hackers who can shoot you five times in the face from 500m away before you've even seen them, hackers who can sit in the blue zone without taking damage, hackers who can instantly use healing items, hackers who can shoot through terrain, and the pseudo-hackers who have recoil macros built into their mouse so they can fire full-auto down a 4x sight at 150m. So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.  So, if you want to feel rage like no other when you spend 25 minutes gathering the best gear, setting up in the best position, then getting shot through a wall by someone you could never even have seen, this is the game for you. If however you're concerned about your blood pressure, might be best to give this one a miss.","1,537.1",363350,0,Recommended

PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,44292021,0,Recommended

You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers.

2020-12-21 00:00:00,"Hey developers, do you guys know there are a lot of people who are blatantly selling hacking softwares on the leaderboard? You can simply tell from their id. So I guess my question would be why you guys haven't banned them yet? I mean they are probably the easiest to be detected. For example, wg123456789 is a very typical id that is selling hacks. I understand that you guys don't speak Chinese but you can reach out to me or other Chinese players. know all the ins and outs of this shady market.",83.4,2031711,0,Recommended

2022-02-17 00:00:00,"What began as groundbreaking has devolved into the utmost trite, overhyped, and unfulfilling nonsense. Hackers in every match. Monetized transactions abound. Most updates come in the form of new outfits and decorations so you can resemble a weeby K-Pop band rather than stronger security or better mechanics. Longstanding issues don't get touched. Devs are here to make money, not build an enjoyable game. As someone who's played since beta, I can say with confidence this game has done nothing but gone downhill.  Worse, now, certain people who cannot change their smoke detectors have discovered this game. Apparently EBT pays for it. Don't bother.","1,705.9",5311919,0,Recommended
2021-02-23 00:00:00,"PUBG was in the right place at the right time to both capitalize on the burgeoning popularity of battle royales and also serve as the vanguard for the entire genre moving forward. Unfortunately, over time a combination of its competition coming out with more polished and refined BRs, alongside a series of baffling design decisions have made the game much less appealing than it was when it came out. I'll always have fond memories of dropping C-Dot and Rozhok, but the legacy of PUBG for me, unfortunately, is one of wasted potential.",484.7,3471019,0,Recommended
2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,3672036,0,Recommended
