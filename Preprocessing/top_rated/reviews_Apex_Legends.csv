2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty?

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update?

No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass!

No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place.

Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return.

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty?

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2021-03-01 00:00:00,"You open the game and finish your 3000 word essay that's due tomorrow while it loads you into the main menu. You pray they fed the server hamsters today as you queue for a game. You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.  10/10.

Unfortunately, her father is a super strong alcoholic who often goes crazy and abuses her from time to time. It's very sad to see her getting worse day by day.

2021-01-04 00:00:00,"I am 41 years old and probably one of the oldest players on Apex Legends servers. I have to say I enjoy this game a lot. I have been playing FPS games since the original Doom, and I played Unreal Tournament (UT) and Quake 3 a lot when they were launched on 1999. To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS. This is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation, good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay. I am married with children and still try to play a few games every night since I found this gem. And best part, it is FREE!! You should definitely give it a try.",718.0,126067167,0,Recommended
