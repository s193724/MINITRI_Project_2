2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless. Please spend your money on something better than this.","1,180.9",8521285,0,Recommended

People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem.

Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out.

All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible.

People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem.

Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.

People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem.

Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out.

Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"This game is absolutely terrible. Warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps. All game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that Activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible. This makes every single game released since the birth of Warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before.  People who keep buying the fully priced DLC they call ""games"" they will be releasing is primarily the problem. However too many Call of Duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out, ""why criticize the game, just don't play it"" because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise.  Activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity. Most obviously apparent in the Zombies mode offerings. In Cold War, every single Zombies map was at least 50% reused assets from the campaign, which then progressed into Vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small-scale outbreak with a single round-based map thrown in there which was also a remake, to now. Modern Warfare III Zombies is quite literally just Warzone DMZ with zombies put in as an environmental hazard. There are no rounds. You have 60 minutes to play, or you get kicked out. There are 24 people on the map, but it is entirely PvE.  The execs at Activision are the worst executives I have ever seen in the video gaming industry. Shamelessly forcing the developers of Call of Duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions, which in reality are MACROtransactions.  You should not support this game or support Activision/Blizzard. Each game released gets lazier and lazier while Activision cries out about how it's the largest and most innovative offering yet, when in reality it's the sloppiest and most soulless.
