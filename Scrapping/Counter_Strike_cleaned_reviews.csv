730,2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”",1770.6,Recommended,256

730,2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.",10379.9,Not Recommended,1324

730,2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

730,2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.",6841.8,Recommended,854

Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,Not Recommended,778

730,2018-10-30 00:00:00,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.

Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.",1117.1,Recommended,207
730,2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun.

730,2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!",1722.0,Recommended,369

I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!!  It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service. It's funny how things happen!!  Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad. There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me. Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from. The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!). Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy? If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for??? Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).  My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.? There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service? It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?! Who know's? Certainly nobody in the community, why? No communication. Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to? A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.  Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.

Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours. When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees. Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly. Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess. Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove from the oil and place on paper towels.

730,2024-09-21 00:00:00,"The suffering I’ve endured from playing Counter-Strike is a complex blend of mental, emotional, and even physical pain. It begins with the countless hours spent grinding in competitive matches, where every loss feels like a personal failure, a reflection of my inadequacies. I’ve experienced the gut-wrenching agony of getting matched with teammates who seem to have no regard for teamwork or strategy, leaving me to carry the game on my own shoulders. The weight of that responsibility crushes my spirit, especially when I still lose despite my best efforts. Every missed shot feels like a betrayal of my own hands, a reminder that no matter how many hours I pour into improving my aim or game sense, there are still moments where I am utterly powerless. The suffocating tension of a 1v1 clutch situation is something I’ve felt in my bones, the pressure building as the seconds tick away, my palms sweating, heart racing, only to die to some sniper crouching in a corner, completely erasing any hope of victory.  The toxicity of the community adds another layer to the pain. It’s not just the personal failures; it’s the verbal abuse that follows. No matter how well I play, there’s always that one teammate who’s quick to hurl insults, to tear down whatever little confidence I’ve built. The constant barrage of blame, the accusations that I’m throwing the game or that I’m a noob, gnaws away at my self-esteem. Every match feels like a battlefield, not just against the enemy team but against my own squad, fighting to maintain my mental stability while being bombarded by insults, racial slurs, and unnecessary aggression. Then there’s the pain of seeing a perfectly executed strategy fall apart due to one small mistake, whether it's a missed flashbang or an ill-timed push. The frustration builds with every game, the crushing realization that even though I’ve spent hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours in the game, I’m still not where I want to be skill-wise.  Physically, the game has taken its toll as well. My back and wrists ache from sitting in the same position for hours, hunched over, eyes glued to the screen, fingers moving in a precise, rapid-fire rhythm. The late nights have robbed me of sleep, leaving me exhausted, but I can’t stop playing because I’m chasing that one good game, that fleeting moment of victory that keeps me coming back, even though deep down I know that satisfaction will never outweigh the frustration. Counter-Strike has become a cycle of suffering, where each win is quickly overshadowed by a string of losses, and every moment of joy is drowned out by the ever-present, gnawing feeling of defeat.  10/10",685.3,Recommended,226

There was zero communication between CSGO and the players, you legit just asked if we were free Wednesday, and now I wish I was busy so I never would of have to play this.  EDIT: A more structured, critical review.  I decided to try the game again to give a better review rather than just lashing out at what I saw earlier, and in a completely honest way, I'm still unhappy, but not as unhappy as I was prior. I still love this game if it is not evident by the number of hours that I have on my account. But still, I have some critiques on this.  The Battle Royale When I heard the idea of a battle royale in CS, I was against it, they've never quite been my thing and the popularity of games like fortnite completely destroyed any hope that I had for battle royales in games. However, CSGO's battle royale does have some pros with some cons at the same time. Do take into account that I am biased against battle royales. Pros: - It's a fresh new take on the battle royale genre. - Thing like escorting hostages add a great addition to the game mode as a way to get money whilst still being involved with anything around you. - The idea of choosing and seeing where others drop is a nice feature.  Cons (take into account I am biased against battle royales): - It doesn't fit well into a CS game, yes I understand that I don't have to play it but it does my head in that it's advertised on the main screen. - Ammo is actually harder to find than real life aliens, the fact that you pick ammo up 1 by 1 doesn't make this any easier. - Drones break if there is a ledge near where you are standing. I bought some ammo and the drone was confused if an inanimate wall was actually me. - The amount of actual shake you receive when getting hit is akin to an earthquake, given I had some fun with my friends going around and bashing people to the point where it's like the Negev in warmup. - Finally, it's a battle royale. You didn't have to follow this trend CS, even if it was planned a while ago.  Free To Play This is one of the more concerning things that I had with the update, CS is already filled with cheaters and can sometimes make the game so irritating that I've put it down for a couple weeks. As 3kliksphilip said its probably the game with the most cheaters (Does CS:GO Updates not entertain you) But now I have some confidence in their decision for making it free to play, it allows more people to experience CS and will most likely double the population which isn't a downside. The thought that Valve has made the game free to play shows that they have confidence in VAC and that VAC will learn a lot more things due to the games new state.  Prime This issue is one of the main reasons that this review is staying as not recommended. The idea that you can pay into prime and that people who have already bought the game will now have instant prime. This kind of makes me think that prime will be reduced to a standard trust factor match which cheaters are somewhat abundant. But if Valve is confident enough in their VAC, this shouldn't be a problem. However, the amount of cheaters who have probably been grinding enough to get prime on multiple accounts is worrying.  Valve in General My issue with prime has nothing on this. Valve don't really know much about their audience. We believe that we are entitled due to the amount of ♥♥♥♥ they have given us in the past years (AUG Week, R8's introduction *solved quickly, nerfing weapon speeds *this affected pros but they can manage now, #HikoMissed). My problem isn't really with this, it's with Valve's transparency, they never tell us what they're going to do and expect us to all love their new idea like its Chef Boyardee's canned pasta. No one has really ever asked for battle royale in CS, we ask for improvements which are normally disregarded.  In short, I'm upset with this update, but not as upset as I once was, I still have faith in Valve although it is withering at a fast pace.  Response to comments: @PapaNotedVevo: Agreed that it makes the player base bigger, dislike the concept of battle royale in cs. @JustSqueeze: Cause why can't I? As long as I have skins and fun with my friends then who cares? @Count Chocula: H1Z1s peak player base was 150,179, it's now 24-hour peak is averaging the 3,000 range. This isn't good for a game, it puts people off from the original concept. @thehemmo: Yeah I agree with you now my man. @waffle.jpeg: I won't play it, I'm not being forced to. It's a bad addition to a competitive game and I won't play it anymore, regarding optimization, I'm glad you can run this on your 12 year old labtop as you said. And yeah I was probably wrong about the optimization thing, some of my friends with lower-end pc's still cannot run it. @RandyCo: Prime isn't mean to be something you can pay for, prime is meant to be for people who have played the long enough and deserve a place where they can play without cheaters, cool VACnet is enabled, I forgot that gets rid of every cheater ever, did you?  I just miss source man, the games only full priced because valve can't afford to make Gmod assets free. If Source-style movement was back in the game, I wouldn't care what happens.",1480.3,Not Recommended,4617

Add them to a mixing bowl.  Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.  Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.  Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.  While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.  Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.  Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.  Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.  Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.  Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.  Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.  Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.  At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.  Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish.

The same goes for previous renditions of this game.  However, I have to give this game my first ever bad review. I believe CSGO has entered the worst state it has ever been in. This is due to the cheating in this game. The entire community is nervous. 90% of games turns into salty game of people blaming everyone of cheating. Sportsmanship is fading. Play one good game you get reported and end up in low trust factor. The developers give no CLEAR information on how this works and what to do to remedy it. Updates of this game is slow and not focused on improving the game state. Last contributing factor is the increasing amount of cheating in pro level games. As a whole it feels that my immediate contacts more or less feels the same and the ""FUN"" factor of the game is just disappearing.  I am slowly starting to lose my respect for this game and might end up leaving CS for good.

Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away.

730,2017-01-29 00:00:00,"**UPDATED REVIEW (05/05/2018) LOOK BELOW **  Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this game  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played... but I still love it  Why? well let me tell ya  I've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage, happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc.  This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on.  Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways.  What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''? Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc, Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying.  Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong time  If you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky.  now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealing  Well, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage.  So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it   -Datsuke 1/29/2017   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- **UPDATE**  Okay, it's been more than a year from my original review, Have I changed my thoughts?.. Sort of.  The game haven't recieved much love from Valve, and Prime matchmaking is still in beta, about Prime matchmaking, for some reason the lobbies always default to trust factor which is horrible, and to my knowledge you cannot make it Prime as default (correct me if I'm wrong).  The community is pretty much the same, nothing has changed on that note.  Now, I have more complains on matchmaking: I used to think that the game itself is broken, I really did, I thought that the hitboxes were messed up (which I have a video example of that, that I recorded myself here: watch it if you wish) but really what is really broken are the matchmaking servers, how do I know this? Well, I been wanting to take the game a little more serious, so I signed up for ESEA which is a paid suscription to other servers that are basically competitive games, the difference here is that the matchmaking servers are 64 tick and the ESEA servers are 128 tick, which is a world of a difference, everything is more accurate when is about headshots and all of that good stuff, and I believe ESEA has more servers so my ping on matchmaking is usually 60-80ms on ESEA servers is around 20-35ms. On ESEA the ranking isn't **AS** broken as matchmaking and the community on ESEA takes the game pretty seriously and don't mess around, which I really like that, however the problem is that it is a paid suscription which not everyone is willing to pay, so there's also FACEIT which provides the same service as ESEA but for free, however Faceit has premium features but payment is not obligated to play.  So, the game is pretty much the same, not many fixes or changes going on, but I wanted to update this review since these third-party services change the game experience dramatically and make the game generally more enjoyable, so give those a try and they make help you like the game a little more, at least it worked for me.  -Datsuke 05/05/2018",2219.5,Recommended,309

730,2013-12-31 00:00:00,"I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.  I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.  I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind.  My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.  I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.  Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.  My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.  Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.  The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.  _   Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.  Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.  Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.  I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.  I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.  The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.  My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.  I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.  I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.  Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.  A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.  Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.  _   Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat.  Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""  Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.  From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.  The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.  Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.  Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.  Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.  Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.  I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.  I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.",3403.1,Recommended,2539
730,2023-08-29 00:00:00,"Well it looks as though Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is coming to an end soon. It makes me sad to think about. This game has had a big impact on my life. I've been playing since the game came out, countless memories. This here video game has to be one of the most refined games i have ever played. Using of the heart of Quake; CS:GO has proven to be the best FPS to date. CS:GO accomplishes so much. This game lets gun play become art. Its almost as if every spray you preform is a unique signature or tag. The guns are consistent and balanced in an refreshing way. Beyond gun play there is the movement. Bunny hopping, surfing, air-strafing, long-jumping. All of these incredible feature with an almost infinite skill ceiling. Zoom out again you have excellent maps, developer and community made. Each map featuring a unique history and lore. If we take another step back from the basic game play CSGO has Skins, and oh baby do i like skins. The style and progression of concept throughout the years. A flourishing economy of trade. Interesting stickers and personal ones that hold the value of a team or moment in time. All of these beautiful ideas and feature of CSGO are blended into this master craft of a video game. I mean i'm barely scratching the surface of depth there is to this iconic online shooter, but i will end this mindless rant with one last appreciation. The developers have stuck with the soul of the community from the start of this game. They have listened and acted with and for the players. Valve has always understood what it means to host a game of this nature, and they should be acknowledged for it. So from one of those players, genuinely, Thank you Valve!",3029.0,Recommended,670

730,2014-06-07 00:00:00,"In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in.  When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body.  The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.  Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.  In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders.  Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.",76.9,Recommended,3276

If you hail from the Call of Duty realm, adapting your gameplay style becomes imperative for success in Counter-Strike. Furthermore, Counter-Strike endeavors to evolve by implementing slight changes, while remaining faithful to its core strengths.

I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.  The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken.  I regret everything I have done.

Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot. - If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die.

However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.  Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.  There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.",5178.1,Recommended,4589

730,2024-10-08 00:00:00,"After nearly 8,000 hours in cs:go, I think it's only fair to commit to saying that I am thoroughly disappointed with CS2. The game has taken the gripping core concept of a counter-strike game, and built around it with the primary goal of building esports and cosmetic frameworks to generate revenue. There have been numerous requests for changes that should have been prioritized, with no exaggeration, since 2015. Anti-cheat and tickrate have been eschewed to spend time developing cosmetics and designing gameplay within the skins economy rather than engaging with the gameplay of the core game. And with all this extra revenue, you really can't afford 128 tick, even just for premier or paying premier players?  The disrespect the continued non-development of the game itself reflects upon the community and the spirit that keeps the game alive should long ago have fractioned the playerbase, but the way back has been walled off by removing csgo from steam (possibly one of the most dishonest, anti-consumer moves i've ever seen). There is nothing honest going on at valve when it comes to cs2, and nothing elevating this game beyond a general shooter other than the allowance from valve for us measly customers to still interact with the core mechanics of counter-strike. perhaps they'll slowly sculpt this game into something decent, but the philosophy and principles pushing the counter-strike project at valve have long since left the realm of mechanics and passion for greener* pastures.",8582.3,Not Recommended,146

730,2017-03-08 00:00:00,"CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.  CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime-matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve.  Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play.  Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general.  Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some game-modes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!  Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates.",2416.2,Recommended,299

730,2022-04-30 00:00:00,"CS:GO came out over 3,500 days ago, almost 10 years. Since 2014, CS:GO has never had less than 250,000 concurrent players. Many games in the last decade which are considered cornerstones of PC gaming, possibly even cornerstones of FPS games in general, never even achieved that many concurrent players at their absolute peak. In 2020, CS:GO hit its all time peak of over a million concurrent players playing all at the same time, an achievement that is likely only shared with truly Earth-shatteringly popular games like LoL and WoW. This is all to say that somehow, despite being almost a decade old, CS:GO remains one of the most popular titles on PC as a whole, beating out such rivals as Apex Legends, Valorant, Warzone, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, and pretty much every other FPS game you can let roll off the tongue, and likely any non-shooter title you can think of as well. I would venture to say that no game aside from Minecraft and PONG has had even remotely close to the staying power of CS:GO.  All that said, the game blows.

Source has completely knee-capped any opportunity for growth and innovation, and with a few minor meta changes and the introduction of new gamemodes and weapons, CS:GO is the same game now that it was 3,500 days ago. Some would argue that this is a sign of perfection, of effortless staying power, but I would argue that it is a sign of a lazy cash grab. Let's be honest, in comparison to modern competitors, CS:GO's movement is incredibly clunky. You can draw a direct lineage between crouch-jumping mid-doors on Dust II to completing puzzles in Black Mesa in Half Life. CS:GO is likely the only game about using firearms that does not allow you to ADS and more or less guarantees the user that the bullets coming from their firearm will not hit what they are looking at unless they have perfect movement, aim, and spray-pattern knowledge. Very few weapons have been added in the last decade, and those that have been added are generally worse in every measurable way to those that they replace. Dust II remains the most popular map and has itself only seen a light graphical upgrade with only a small handful of map design changes. New maps are introduced, regularly complained about, and removed from the current map pool. If you are reading this in 2032, Dust II is likely still the most popular map and likely remains un-upgraded.  Socially, the game is terrible. The vast majority of the user base is either incredibly toxic, racist, cheating, or a combination of all three. The way that matchmaking works, it is easy to come across smurf after smurf after smurf, losing game after game after game to players who's real skill is likely 10x higher than CS:GO placed them. I cannot begin to count the number of games in which I was subjected to player's profile pictures that were outright pornographic or I was called racial or homophobic slurs. ""Toxic"" does not even begin to describe how inhumane the CS:GO community can be at times.  So thus far, I have established that CS:GO is one of the most popular games on PC that has time and time again outlasted better competitors, I have dogpiled the game for looking, sounding, and playing like a game from 1998, and I have called all of the userbase toxic cheaters. If I believe all of these things, how can I possibly recommend the game? Easy - I only play CS:GO with friends. I play for fun and to collect skins. Many an hour has been spent, three or four beers deep, just chatting and joking with friends with CS:GO on in the background. Three, four, or even five-stacking pub matches is incredible fun. Playing the game in a public lobby where you and your friends work through elaborate, practiced routines of memes and jokes with poor, unsuspecting randoms is easily one of the funniest things you can do with a microphone and PC. Stupendous fun can be had when you find a player who has a sense of humor who will joke around with you as much as you with them. Every game is a win when you play with friends - you either lose the game so that your skill rating drops and you get to pub stomp the next lobby, or you win the game and your skill rating increases so that you can get pub stomped next game, thus setting you up for your own pub stomp. This circuitous motion is what keeps the game fun and fresh, you either get dumpstered on, dumpster a team, or the CS:GO matchmaking works for once and you have to fight for your life to get that 15:15. CS:GO sucks as a game, and you will never, ever see me playing it alone. But as a medium by which you can interact with your friends, CS:GO is unbeatable. Put a 30-rack in the fridge, get some T-Bell delivered, and get four friends who cannot hit the accept button with their aim and I guarantee you will make a life-long meme between the five of you.",754.3,Recommended,252
730,2023-10-14 00:00:00,"This game got replaced. The reviews are from cs:go which was a way better game. They replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game.  CS 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps, community servers, battle royale, surf, zombies mods and more. Additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when I cannot play at all which never happened in cs:go. This game is incomplete and shouldn't take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully. New graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasn't worth it. I was hyped for CS 2 but it's not ready to replace CS: GO and they shouldn't remove an existing game and turn off CS:GO servers, it should be just a separate game as it always was with CS series.  I feel scammed especially that I bought CS:GO when it was still a paid game. They took a game I paid for and replaced with some silly remake.",311.6,Not Recommended,291

730,2021-02-11 00:00:00,"This game saved my life.  I am 42.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Valves release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2012 was a disaster that took YEARS before the game was competitively polished. Fast forward 11 years and Valve is mirroring their routine with another disgraceful release. Even more laughable is the fact that their company assets and resources have more than tripled in those 11 years.  What the community PRIMARILY wanted with cs2: 1. Anti-cheat that actually works 2. 128 tick servers for MM 3. A better MM system (not relevant if the AC doesn't work)  What the community got with cs2: - map collision - player collision - ""subtick"" masking 64 tick - bad audio, inferior movement - frame drops, poorly optimized - awful hitreg & interp / dying behind walls / getting kills when your crosshair isn't on the enemy - The anti-cheat doesn't work.

You can't deny that Counter-Strike has the best shooter mechanics of any game out there, and the tactical side is genius. Being a skilled aimer does not get you nearly as far as being smart and knowing all of the maps better than your opponent.  It really is sad that CS:GO has made such a bad name for itself due to the gambling issues and Valve's lack of cooperation, but somehow it is still one of the most played games on the platform.

These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.   Pros. ◘ Match Making. ◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level. ◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments. ◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard. ◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game. ◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter. ◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch! ◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.    ◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved. ◘ Game could use some optimization here and there. ◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.",11190.7,Recommended,2409

Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following:  - It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's insults opinions. ""Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake."" - It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores. - It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. ""Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle."" - It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong. - It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while.

You can call me ""bad"" ""Terrible"" ""They're just better"" But iv been playing since 2013, I know who is legit and who is blatantly cheating.  Project A will not kill csgo, Its very different, looks more like overwatch. Im not afraid of csgo dying, but what i am worried about is new players dealing with cheating, Getting annoyed and then cheat themselves. This is why there are so many cheaters. VAC is not a good anti cheat.  I do not recommend buying prime unless your willing to deal with 5 days of cheaters, then hopefully having a good trust factor where there are no cheaters.   Valve, You should really implement a trust factor XP bar, or something so you can tell if yours is good or not. The current system is broken, You sometimes have cheaters with new accounts, and sometimes 5 year old players who are obviously not cheating. The current system is broken and needs to be fixed.  If you still sit here and think this is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ill link a video soon, I bought a new account, and played 1 game, All good no cheaters, Played another one. Spinbotters who crash the server so they dont get Overwatched because it corrupts the demo. I have proof for all of this.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Initial Review  Counterstrike is and always will be a amazing game. The reason its having its downfalls is due to the 78% of the community uses cheats. VAC is the WORST anti cheat there is out there, This is something a 12 year old could bypass in his computer class at school. You can code walls in less than 1 hour. Theres nothing protecting this game!!!!  VALVE project A will DESTROY CSGO if you do not implement another anti cheat. EAC is better than this garbage.  Honestly dont waste your money on this game if you have no trust factor or low, Queing with people who have Low Trustfactor is the worst thing you can do. Its all cheaters who HVH in MM.  I suggest removing Trust Factor or fix it. I que with someone who gets a 7 day due to kicking players who ♥♥♥♥ around in comp then he has Low Trust Factor, Then we que with hackers.  Please for ♥♥♥♥ Sakes valve fix your game. Remove these scums so us LEGIT old players actually have a fun time instead of leaving this game..  THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH PURCHASING DO NOT PLAY IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE GOOD TRUST FACTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2489.4,Not Recommended,129
730,2018-03-22 00:00:00,"I am JokemL, and I am a CS:GO player. I have played 3000+ hours, over multiple accounts. I have now decided to write a ""little"" review.  I cannot remember that much from when I first got the game, but it went something like this:  Play one game-quit-next day-play one game-quit, and that went on for a little while. Now that I am a little older and know the game better then I did just 6-7 years ago, I can tell you what I like and dislike about this game.  Starting with what I like about this game: I like that there is a solid community around the game, though there is alot of scammers/hackers/others, but there is always someone kind just around the corner.  When I started playing CS I liked the pistols on CT cause I felt like I was in the police force. I also liked the AWP and the Ak-47 cause of the insane damage I got with it. I did not really use the other guns, but other people played better with it.  The game felt really good at the start and I was ready to become a pro. Getting a rank was not a big deal for me at the time, only playing Deathmatch or Gun Game most of the time. I cannot even remember my first ever rank.  My tips to new players: Do not care about what rank you get. Start by having fun and playing on your own level.  After watching a lot of videos on how to get better and improve this and that, I started playing more seriously. Changing my settings to what the pros had, Using other crosshairs, viewmodels and such. I started playing better and doing better on the scoreboard.  I started warming up everyday to keep me on the level I was. Playing with friends that have good game sence and microphones, and having good communication was the key to a better experience and a happy rankup.  Youtubers that posts tips and tricks:     And there is a lot more people that posts tips and tricks.  What I dislike about the game:  Starting with Hackers. There is always going to be some kind of cheaters in CS and that it's hard for valve to ban them all, but I think they could do better. The amount of hackers I meet on a daily bases is just insane, example wingman. In wingman there is atleast one hacker in 1-3 matches, and I have reported so many of them and up to 20% of they have been banned but up to 80% of they still allowed to play on valve secured servers. This is a problem.  Toxic. You may have heard the word toxic before, you may even be toxic. There is alot of players that are toxic, saying bad words to you, been hateful towards you, telling you that you are bad and things like that. This is a problem that will never be solved, just because of how many plays the game and how many people that gets mad if someone is bad or you losing a game. Toxic players is hard to deal with and you have to either mute him or just try to talk to him in a normal way.  Scammers. Scammers is also a thing that ruins the game for most people. To lose alot of money because of a scammer is not the most fun thing on this planet. it has happened to me aswell, loseing over $200 cause of a scam is not fun at all. Thats why you always should double check every trade you do. (Don't trust people over the internet)  I love operations, but it takes so long before the next operation, so we just sit and wait for over 1 year... This is something that makes me a little angry. CS is the same over and over again and that is not a bad thing, but we would love to sit back and relax with a operation.  Overall I like this game and I think you would like it aswell.  Thanks.

730,2020-04-08 00:00:00,"My Thoughts and Opinions on CS:GO CS:Go is one of those games that has a really dedicated and rabid fanbase thanks to incredible success of Counter Strike 1.6. Released in 2012 and eight years later, the fast-paced PC game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles, partly because of its established core gameplay and huge active community. A big part of its success is due to its massive esports following. It’s always talked about in streaming sites whether its Twitch and Mixer. The game even includes its own ""watch a match"" section so you can follow and spectate live tournaments and competitive matches. CS:GO is also very easily accessible. It’s free and all you need is a potato with a fine keyboard and mouse and maybe a headset with a mic. It runs on basically any PC with decent frames rate. A High-End PC should give you over 300fps at ultra-details. You don’t need anything fancy or powerful to enjoy which is another reason why there’s so big player base.  Pros +Valve has done everything it can to evolve the game and keep it fresh by staying true to the series. +One of the greatest competitive first-person shooters you can play on Steam +Massive player base and a game that refuses to die! +Includes several maps and nine game modes types including the standard team based PvP casual modes, competitive, deathmatch, arms race, community made maps and servers and even a 16 player Battle Royale mode (but you shouldn’t really play it for Battle Royale as its mostly barebones and ugly). +100% skill-based gameplay and no casual power-ups like seen in Halos and Call of Duty. +CS: GO relies heavily on reaction time and twitchy movements. Thus, line-of-sight is one of the biggest advantages you can create. +Excellent sound design (but very unrealistic at the same time). +Bullet physics and explosions are still impressive for an engine that is now 16 years old. +Excellent performance. Runs well even on potatoes and 10-year-old PCs and laptops. +An example of “games as a service” done well.  -Well, you’ll often find some gamers helpful and tolerable to newbies, the mass playerbase is unwelcoming and very toxic. Playing without friends is not recommended. -Negative behavior includes trolls in the team chats, people who scream into their mics, and people who simply can't keep quiet :D Some of them might even vote to kick you out because you're new to CS. -Plenty of hackers and cheaters that ruin the fun and fair-play for everyone. VAC engine is mostly automated and not moderated by Valve's employees unless during a few rare cases. The anti-cheat is okay but not any better than other anti-cheat solutions seen on PC. So yeah! Cheating exist nearly everywhere these days. -Technically CS:Go looks very dated and mediocre. It hasn’t changed a lot from CS: Source. The graphics are mediocre and 2008ish. Graphics haven’t improved relatively much since 2004’s Half Life 2. -Aggressive monetization to the point it’s become a live gambling show. Players can choose to spend real money on items and cosmetic material like weapon skins. Winning and completing tasks rewards you loot boxes that can be unlocked by purchasing keys with real money!!! Too much trading could even lead to online gambling addiction.  CS:GO is one of the most fine-tuned first-person shooters to date. Sure, while it may look like a 15-year-old game and there might be major issues, but the fact that the community is thriving speaks volumes, this means that this game will constantly be tweaked towards perfection.",723.9,Recommended,166

But u know what, we have to become a better version of ourselves and don't blame valve for everything i know that they are not trying very hard but u know u and us together we can grow this community more. If u know ur friend is hacker UN-friend him off-course its your choice to do so and yeah reporting works too. And if u r a HACKER AND READING THIS then man!!! go and hack pubg and fortnite bruh!! those games are kind of open world and 99 people to kill im sure you'll have more fun or just play vice city type panzer and go berserk.  So, as to increase the community, please guys don't be toxic, if you play well do not think that everyone will play like you. People have problems like PC, internet or equipment issues. And yeah if you are determined to win then go to competitive MM with known people, create a team, i know it isn't easy but you'll find people. But please in case u want only to have fun or only to win then for god's sake don't play solo queue and ruin other people experience. If you r solo queuing than try to adapt to the team.

And most important don't get angry on new people just try to give them directions not everyone who play csgo want to go pro most of the community people want to have a good time with friends and win.

Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't.  ""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?  Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.  I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...  Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.  For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.  For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.  TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues.

730,2021-04-15 00:00:00,"CS:GO is a tactical shooter game that has been around for several years now, and it has continued to gain popularity over time. The game is set up in a way that players take turns playing as terrorists or counter-terrorists in a series of rounds. The objective of the terrorists is to plant a bomb while the counter-terrorists try to prevent them from doing so.  One of the reasons why CS:GO has become so popular is because of its highly competitive gameplay. The game requires players to have good teamwork, strategy, and communication skills to win. There are also various weapons and equipment available to players, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages.  Another reason why CS:GO is such a popular game is because of its highly engaging and addictive gameplay. The game requires a lot of skill and practice to master, which means that players are always looking to improve and get better. This makes the game highly replayable, as there is always something new to learn and new challenges to overcome.  In terms of graphics and audio, CS:GO may not be the most visually stunning game out there, but it does have its own unique style and charm. The audio effects in the game are also well-designed and add to the overall immersion of the game.  The graphics in CS:GO with next upgrade to Counter-Strike 2 are impressive, with detailed textures and realistic environments that help to immerse you in the game. The sound design is also excellent, with realistic weapon sounds and environmental effects that add to the overall atmosphere.  Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fantastic tactical shooter that is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.

730,2016-11-12 00:00:00,"Main Review  This review is carefully worded explanation on my 'departure' from CS:GO and why in its current state, I would not recommend the game. This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all.  So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top.  So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc.  The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though.  Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes.  In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up.  Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game.  TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.   In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly.",2061.9,Not Recommended,1438

730,2024-07-18 00:00:00,"It's completely filled to the brim with cheaters.  Update 1/21/25: - Unskilled players are now using DMA (Direct Memory Access) PCI Cards to cheat - Combined with a second PC - a DMA card slotted in PC A sends realtime memory to PC B which can then be read/analyzed/acted upon - PC B can simply read the memory on PC A, and can send realtime undetectable ESP onto PC A when combined with a display fuser - DMA Card when also combined with a M&K Controller (""KMBox""), PC B can send realtime inputs (Aimbot, Triggerbot, etc) to PC A - DMA Card can be repeatedly flashed with new firmware making detection near impossible - There is an entire black market for undetectable firmware - Valve doing nothing about these DMA Cards on top of not even issuing a statement shows they simply do not care about the ""elite competitive experience"" - Valve will take action against legitimate players finding a loophole in the Armory Pass, and in a few hours - but will not take any concrete action against players abusing the entire game (hacking) and for years  - VAC is the worst anti-cheat in existence. Valve takes HWID of users however, they will not ban based on HWID. They only ban by account so the hacker can just make a new one and do it all over again. - Valve is making a huge profit off NOT banning hackers. When a hacker gets their account banned, they just get another one and purchase prime ($15). Valve clearly sees this as a revenue source and will never actually take any real action against cheaters. - There is a secondary market for leveling fresh accounts to premiere and selling them, people use inexpensive hacks to level accounts and then re-sell them for more - People are running automated AI-based bots that can dupe weapons and automatically cheat same as in TF2 - Premiere game mode is completely off balance. Once you reach 10k+ ELO your matches will only net you ~50-100 ELO and you will lose between ~300-1000 every game. Complete timesink. - Valve's ""subtick"" is garbage. The game will always have peeker's advantage - if you have a high ping around around 50ms-100ms you will always have that much more time to see someone on your screen before they will see you - Public ""find a group"" feature is filled with Russians posing as ""professional"" players who invite you to lobbies, try to get you into a discord channel and then socially engineer you to ""signup for their team"" which is a steam account phishing page.  Game is still fun and a classic - but is clearly still in an alpha development stage. Valve trying to claim or boast that CS2 is a ""competitive"" shooter is completely invalid. Any ""competitive"" teams are phony. Faceit, ESEA and competitive game modes all filled with blatant cheaters. You could dump years of time into this game trying to ""git gud"" but you will never beat the script kiddies let alone be able to keep up with the constant updates to the game mechanics.

Dev's don't listen to the players and just do things to the game nobody wanted.  What players asked: New missions and 128-tick servers. What do we get? We get some nice updates of never wanted gloves with free game breaking addons. Oh how about we give you a nice new sound system nobody wanted just because we can.  Let's talk about the VAC system (Valve Anti Cheat): Probally one of the worst working anti cheat systems out there. People can go spinbotting / wallhacking ingame without insta triggering red flags, no they just get a some people in overwatch after 10 reports looking at it. Instead of building a better VAC system to help keep the game fun and fair, they give us gloves and game breaking addons. But I guess if they made the VAC system better half of the pro's out there get insta banned and then it's bye bye CS:GO.  Soon 1.000 hours for me, never had a higher then 0.03€ skin drop, a friend of mine played, gets a 250€ M4A1-S drop with his first deathmatch... It's random but maybe recode it so things like this don't happen because it absolut BS.  But after all, I enjoy the game even tho 1/3 games gives a hacker and 1/2 games give a high chance of dropping you in a game full of russians.  VALVE, fix your game like the PEOPLE want it: - 128-tick servers - Better VAC system, even tho half the pro's gets banned - Fix bugs in the game / maps instead of adding gloves just to get more money - Different servers for RU / EU with no way to mix those together - Fix those damn hitboxes - Add that's it recommended to have a microphone and have some basic English knowledge.

730,2017-10-19 00:00:00,"CS:GO, I mean the game itself is very fun but there is a huge issue that makes the experience so terrible. Once you reach a decently high rank in matchmaking that is Legendary Eagle Master and above, 60% of the games you will proceed to play will be against cheaters. These cheaters use paid cheats of at least ($40USD) per month; and they bypass overwatch by closet cheating, which means they hide their cheats by trying to look legit. This allows them to bypass overwatch as they hide their cheats quite well and make their shots look as if it was all luck. I myself have been queued against cheaters 8 games in a row in LEM-GE matchmaking. Because of stuff like this I've started moving onto other games such as Overwatch (the game from Blizzard). I actually enjoy CS:GO more than Overwatch but the game is filled with cheaters in the higher matchmaking ranks that ruins the experience for people like myself. The situation is actually disgusting, where we now have people who queue with cheaters in order to gain a high rank, because at this point if you want to reach and maintain GE you either queue with cheaters or become one; at least in the Oceania scene of matchmaking. And I forgot to mention that this is in Prime matchmaking, which is supposed to be fairly safe. These cheaters also have groups where they admit to cheating, even inviting more people to join them and play matchmaking while they either boost them or cheat together. CS:GO as a game is great, but I really hope Valve puts a hold on adding new skins all the time and actually makes a decent anti-cheat which bans all those external software users. Many people suggest ESEA, but there are people like me who have no interest of going pro or playing at tournaments in the future, ESEA is for people who are serious and dedicated to the game; for those who are looking to be a step ahead. I'm just a normal player who enjoys the game, I'm not looking to go big in CS, so I do not see why someone like myself would need to pay to play a legit game of ranked CS:GO. What's funny is a third party matchmaking client has a better anti-cheat than a multi-millionaire company like Valve. The VAC waves of one cheat are not enough. There are many other cheats out there and new ones are made all the time. I really like this game but at this point I feel like quitting due to stuff like this. This is why for now I won't recommend this game; not unless Valve at least manages to actually fix this issue.",1289.6,Not Recommended,537

730,2023-11-05 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike 2 has been rushed into live compounded by the moronic decision to replace CSGO completely instead of being it's own game.  CS2's implementation of the networking system, ""Subtick"", is god ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful and in my opinion is vastly inferior to CSGO. I have never felt like I have no idea where my bullets are going until CS2. I can be dead on some one with my crosshairs, steady stance, unload a mag in precise bursts and the server reports zero hits. There have been plenty of clear blatant examples of poor hit rig with people shooting point blank on someone not moving and still missing, just watching the bullets go right through them.

Lets not get started on the fact that what replaced a playable CSGO on all spectrum's (network and performance) has been replaced with a very poorly optimised mess that requires a top-end PC to have even semi-decent FPS. While with CSGO you could have a relatively low-end system and still play at reasonable FPS - now this eldritch monstrosity will sap every ounce of power from your rig and cry out for more.

730,2022-07-22 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike:Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve, it is extemely difficult considering you have to wrangle your teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies' economy, buy the correct sh*t then aim for the head and spray correctly; then there is a bunch of extra sh*t like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the fu*k not; it's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse, there is a story that someone was so good with his mouse, he bacame the mouse, the mouse permanently fused into his hand, now he has to use his other hand for certain things; the game has multiple maps including Dust 2, which is the only map, and Mirage but Mirage just really isn't working these days; the game will bring you many fun experiences like playing with Aldon Hilter as he only buys a Negev and unpolitely refuses to buy anything else as we lose 14-16 against 4 bots; this game is fun in the words of a certain person this is fu*king gameplay: you can play as the terrorists and blow sh*it up while praising the one god or you can play as the counter terrorists who counter the terrorists terrorizing terrorism; some of the guns are: the Deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, but the most important and deadliest of all is the decoy grenade, not many people know that every Decoy grenade is sent from the deepes circle of hell where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity; on your journey to become better at this game you will encounter smurfs, non-billingual russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realise that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation or at least will make you conider that being true, but the worst of all the people who type ""Nice Try"" after you fu*king fail your shi*ty clutch attempt; there are a lot of mods for the game like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, Jailbreak, and a lot of other stuff; I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money, every skin is different and has a different price ranging your generic pistol skin to a 1600$ knife skin; it's a great game, it's also perfectly fu*king free, so go get it.",466.5,Recommended,106

However, now I'm at the top end of the game, you struggle to find a legit game where there isn't any cheaters. You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).
