578080,2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

578080,2020-01-17 00:00:00,"After 2 years and 2,200 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.",2808.4,Not Recommended,1216
578080,2020-04-26 00:00:00,"3 years and 3,500 hours of gameplay and this game is still a joke. Very clunky, glitches, bugs, FPS drops, desync, you name it! Still, I can live with all of the above...  One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.  I have no faith in what the developers say or promise anymore. Utterly disappointed.",6186.4,Not Recommended,709

578080,2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,Not Recommended,880

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel. Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions.

When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

578080,2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.",2850.9,Not Recommended,688

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

578080,2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,Recommended,438

The prevalence of cheating on the OC servers during peak times is alarmingly pervasive, with multiple cheating teams active in each match. While it remains feasible to prevail against cheaters, the experience is markedly frustrating.  The consequences for caught cheaters are notably lenient, typically resulting in bans spanning from 24 hours to a maximum of three days, with permanent bans being exceptionally rare occurrences.  The development team's focus on cosmetic updates, while aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately detracts from addressing the pressing issue of cheating. By prioritizing the mitigation of cheating, the game stands to retain and engage a larger player base, consequently fostering increased investment in cosmetics.  Furthermore, the repercussions of attempting to expose cheating through platforms such as YouTube, as evidenced by the flagging and subsequent banning of my friend's YouTube account by Krafton.  I implore the developers to reevaluate their priorities and allocate resources towards effectively combating cheating, thereby safeguarding the integrity and longevity of the game for its dedicated community.

So the playing field never feels level - you're constantly battling not only against fair-playing enemies, but against a raft of players using third-party software to win. PUBG Corp don't care about improving it - they routinely ban hackers but then make another $30 when the hacker buys another copy. There is no incentive there for them.

578080,2018-02-08 00:00:00,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?  Mistakes / poor decisions:  - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.  - Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.  - No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.  - Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).  - Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.  - STEREO sound... what year is this??  - Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.    - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.  - Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).  - Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.  - Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.  If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.  - Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!  - Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.  - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.  If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.    It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.  All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.  The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.  There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".  Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.  To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.  PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.  Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.  Recent tests:  Netcode 101:",324.5,Not Recommended,4429

Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

After 2 weeks of play one of my close friends RECEIVED A 3 DAY BAN as he was about to eliminate the last man in our game and win a chicken dinner. I've played this game for 4 years and I or any of my friends have never received a ban for any reason whatsoever. Apparently if one is good at the game, and gets reported enough times, they receive a ban WHILE THEY ARE INVESTIGATED. As a business that is slowly losing its customer base, the worst possible thing you could do is ban a player temporarily ONLY based on how many people have reported them. What you should be doing is investigating them while they play or if not closely after they finish games so you actually have solid evidence before you ban someone. Krafton can spout back rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies all they want. But coming back to a game and getting banned for not doing anything wrong, makes my friends and I feel like uninstalling the game and never playing it again.

578080,2023-06-14 00:00:00,"A Disaster Unfit for Competitive Play… TL;DR » If you are contemplating giving this game a try in 2023, I highly discourage playing it due to it being infested by hackers. To be quite honest, it has reached a state where it could be aptly dubbed as ""Chinese Players' Hacking Grounds.""  » PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG, burst onto the gaming scene with the intention of intense battle royale action and addictive gameplay. However, after extensive time spent playing the game, it has become clear that it is ultimately a flawed experience. With nearly a thousand hours, this review aims to highlight the major reasons why PUBG fails to deliver on its potential and falls short as a game.  Performance Issues » One of the most glaring issues with PUBG is its poor optimization and numerous performance problems. Even on high-end systems, players often encounter frustrating lag, frame rate drops, and overall instability. Six years into its release, this game still frequently crashes and displays abrupt error messages. These technical flaws significantly detract from the immersion and hinder gameplay enjoyment. Despite several updates attempting to address these issues, the game continues to suffer from persistent performance problems.  » Like any shooter game, precise hit detection is essential. Unfortunately, PUBG’s hit registration is notoriously unreliable, leading to ridiculously unfair encounters. Shots that appear to be on target often fail to register, while others seem to land miraculously. This inconsistency greatly undermines the game’s competitive integrity and can quickly frustrate even the most patient players. The game’s netcode is largely at fault here, as it causes discrepancies through delayed or inconsistent server updates that lead to inaccurately registered shots. Furthermore, the realistic bullet physics and travel time add complexity to the hit detection system, as the trajectory of bullets over long distances in real-time strikes a challenge due to the latency between what is shown on screen and what the server interprets.  » Perhaps the biggest problem with PUBG is the prevalence of hackers. Since the dawn of 2018, the game has been plagued with cheaters, and it can be undoubtedly said that every 9 out of 10 games, players will encounter a player with some sort of illegitimate advantage. Developers have struggled to combat the use of aimbots, wallhacks, and other unfair exploits, which has led to a toxic atmosphere. Although several measures have been taken such as adding anti-cheat software and frequent ban waves, the sheer number of hackers that play this game outweighs these efforts. It is important to mention that the game’s immense popularity in China has significantly contributed to a larger player base from that region, which has increased the likelihood of encountering hackers. That said, the accessibility of cheat software in the Chinese gaming market has made it incredibly easy for players to acquire and use them.  » Lastly, PUBG’s struggle to provide a balanced meta is a significant concern. Weapons play a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and viability of different options, but unfortunately, the game’s weapon balancing has become increasingly erratic with each update. Some weapons are severely overpowered, granting a distinct advantage to those who wield them, while others pale in comparison. The awful random loot distribution exacerbates this issue, as unlucky players may find themselves on the receiving end of extremely bad luck, struggling to acquire adequate gear for battle. This tilts the playing field and removes the equal footing that battle royales are meant to provide during the early game.  Vehicle balancing also adds to the list of issues, as vehicles play a crucial role in traversing through the vast maps, heavily influencing the outcome of combat engagements. Unsurprisingly, certain vehicles have proven to be overly resilient, allowing players to exploit their durability and survive an excessive amount of damage. Countering drive-by shootings, especially with the top speeds that some cars reach, poses an incredible challenge unless properly equipped.  » Regrettably, despite PUBG’s pioneering role in the battle royale genre, its ongoing issues and lack of substantial improvements have tarnished its reputation, making it a poor choice for newcomers. Players seeking stability, balance, and enjoyment should explore alternatives like or , which have learned from PUBG’s successes and failures to provide a more refined and satisfying gameplay experience. As for the near future, the dwindling player count only indicates the game's ongoing decline.    » If so, please leave a rating. Awards are also greatly appreciated!",1516.6,Not Recommended,520

578080,2020-07-04 00:00:00,"After much consideration, despite still enjoying the game and having played quite a bit of it, I have decided to write my opinion about certain aspects of the game and recommend against purchasing this game from now on.  The active online community and the good decisions in some game design, particularly regarding gunplay, make PUBG one of the best and most fun online shooters out there. Sadly, other awful and catastrophic design decisions have been made in other aspects of the game.  Despite having finished its Early Access period and having received dozens of patches, with console adaptations and even a Lite version having been released, the game is still in a very poor state in performance and stability. Random errors depending on the GPU you use, unplayable framerate for just being a driver behind, unpolished physics and a poor netcode, overall make the experience mediocre at best from a technical point of view.  But the worst and biggest offence is bots. And I'm not talking about player aim bots, I am talking about the official bots added by the developers in a recent update, in patch 7.x  According to some websites, the inclusion of bots to casual matches was to make it ""a little bit easier for newer players to learn"", which is a fair reason. According to the developers they manually made a lot of adjustations to the bot system to make the bots feel like real players, while still performing in average slightly worse than a decent player, and some other tweaks to their pathing and loot logic would prevent bots from being simple loot farms for human players.  The problem is that the application couldn't be farthest from the theory.  For starters, the bots are very, very dumb. This doesn't come at a surprise at first considering the alleged reason they exist is solely to help newbies to learn the game. Thing is, you couldn't imagine just how BAD the bots are. Erratic in their movement, super simple pathfinding and a very thin repertory of movement patterns overall. I have literally seen them run TOWARDS the blue zone, or simply run in roads and open fields instead of taking cover, simply standing still to aim and shoot at someone. You can easily, quickly tell from the very first time you see a bot to realize that it is indeed a bot and not a human.  Then you have the loot. You'd think that with the ""prevent them from being loot farms"" line, that would mean that bots simply do not min-max assault + sniper rifle combinations and do not loot advanced items from crates. Well, if you thought their loot logic was.. logical, you thought very wrong. They're beyond awful at looting. Not only they blatanly ignore healing items and level 2 armor, but they choose the worst possible combinations of guns, carrying close to mid-range assault rifles as snipers and UZIs in the late game. Both healing items and level 2 armor are extremely common and easy to come with, so it makes absolute 0 sense that you'd have the bots be awfully geared for the reason of preventing them being loot farms.  And lastly and most importantly, you have their prevalence. I am not sure about the specific amount of bots that can be spawned in a single match, but there have been more matches than not where I have faced literal ZERO human players. I have had games where I've won a winner chicken dinner without having faced a single human player, having the last 2-3 remaining players, all bots, simply dying in the blue zone or just standing still waiting to get a headshot. It is an extremely underwhelming experience.  This leads me to think that the actual reason the developers have added bots is to artificially counter the drop in active players in PUBG rather than ""helping newbies"".  The sole inclusion of bots and their prevalence leads to matches giving an extremely bad player experience to humans. From more than 10 times I have dropped in Pochinki, not even 1 time more than 2 other human players have dropped with me. Once one of the main most active and fun early zones in the game, has been reduced to a deserted, boring city where you might headshot the ocassional bot standing still.  All of this not only affects regular players' experience by making bots simple annoyances, but they render their ""teach newbies the game"" argument worthless, since no one can seriously learn how to properly play the game by having the majority of the players in a match be simple bullet sponges who stand still for you to headshot them.  It gives an extremely misleading and awful image of what the PUBG experience is. It sucks for both newbies and veteran players, and make what once was a super fun game to a mixed bag of disappointing and boring experiences.  I really hope the developers seriously reconsider the inclusion of this feature.",662.8,Not Recommended,367

578080,2020-07-27 00:00:00,"Let me tell you a sad story, in it's prime (which was still no where near an optimized game mind you) this was the best battle royale on the market. It was literally genre defining, I am not sure if my friends and I will ever experience such an awesome level of teamwork and immersion in a video game ever again. I will not fail to mention the spectacular feeling of achievement when you earn your first victory after relentlessly grinding for so long, only then to see them pour in as your hard work and dedication to improvement starts to pay dividends.  Unfortunately however, as time went on the developers ignored their fanbase and developed elements of the game that were not desired. They continued down that avenue relentlessly despite losing more and more players as time went on. With thousands of experienced gamers screaming at them what they should be doing, they pressed on, putting their efforts into micro-transactions and continuous map improvements when their attention should of been eliminating hackers to as much of an extent as possible, correcting their matchmaking issues to ensure English speakers and non-English speakers were not placed in the same team (or any other variation of matchmaking error did not occur), and optimizing the potentially greatest gaming foundation that they already had.  I have not played since the inclusion of bots, I believe it was to compensate for a dwindling player base but I honestly would've preferred to wait in lobby for 5-10 minutes between games than play with bots. The addition of bots is all the warning you need, this game is dead, it has fulfilled its purpose in the industry and now it is up to sensible developers to implement something that will clearly work, with precision and dedication to their playerbase.

578080,2017-04-11 00:00:00,"I left a review for this game pretty much a year and a month ago. It was a positive review, as the hype for PUBG and the new game was quite interesting. For reference, here were my negative thoughts back then:  Cons: -Servers - Spawing in is horrific. I've noticed it more in solos, but during landing (another con) and the first few minutes, people will teleport around, and you will occasionally rubber band. After a few minutes its alright. -Landing - Jumping out of the plane - fine. Flying down - fine. Actually landing with the parachute - Painful, infuriating and slow. If you're not over flat ground be prepared to decend at around 1 nanometre a second, and if you land on a wall or in between a narrow space, be prepared to hang there for around a minute, spamming F to cut your parachute but it wont let you. -Perfomance - Not really a con, more of a warning, but I run the game at around 40fps with a 960 with everything on low. You'll need a beefy card to run the game well.  One year and one month down the line, the only thing that has improved there is performance. I now get 100+ frames just about anywhere that isnt a big city.  The servers and general movement mechanics are what upset me the most in this game. Movement is still clunky and awkward. It's near impossible to climb a head-height box without your character jumping off the other side. The parachuting is still awful. Servers are a little better, but still noticeably bad in some situations.  Plus, the devs seem to prefer adding skins and maps rather than fixing bugs.  Mirimar was a mistake. It's a horrible map. Battle royale games should be more shooting than running, which is achieveable in the old map and the new map, but Mirimar is way too large. If you dont get a vehicle then you're basically boned. Not to mention the pathetic excuse of map design in it as well. The terrain is so random and bumpy you cannot drive on it too fast or you'll crash, spin out, or die.

The devs also still try to force inferior ""fun"" maps onto the player base that nobody asked for and very few want to play. But you´re being forced to queue with those maps, as map choice has been removed due to the decline of player numbers (suprise), resulting in getting the map you actually want to play maybe ONCE in TEN games. But instead of listening to the player base, to pros and streamers that once played this on a regular base, the arrogant devs will rather change the train paths on stupid Dickendi than consider constructive feedback and implement actual improvements. Ugly skins and uselss taunts will be in the shop every other week, while some basic bugs and a hideous tickrate of the servers are still an issue since day one. Remove the childish 3pp mode instead of removing map choice? Nooo. Integrate the pro settings to avoid a split between ranked and normal gameplay? Nooo.

First some PROS: + Still might have some potential... + Highly competitive -> no storytelling, just get in the action (for those who want this kind of games). + Thrilling -> reaching the finale is a quite an adrenaline boost, you have to focus in, stay sharp and vigilent. + Quite difficult -> weapon mechanics for example: bullet drop, recoil, weapon attachments, bullet travel speed, damage etc. have to be considered and make the game harder to master thus more interesting and rewarding.  Now let's get to the points which make all the PROS above irrelevant. The developers managed to turn this game into absolute garbage:  - Doesn't matter what kind of PC you have: Crashes, Stutters, FPS Drops 24/7 - Doesn't matter how fast your internet is: Their servers don't give a damn - Doesn't matter how good of a player you are: You die to game bugs, lags, freezes, crashes, desync ent. - Doesn't matter if developers see these comments: You get crates with fancy clothes to dress your character and patches that continue to ruin the gameplay and performance. - Doesn't matter that new maps are released: All of them are unplayable due to the horrible server performance/netcode - Doesn't matter if you actually want to play: ""Servers are too busy. Please try again later.""  A few examples: * You land with a large group o people around that try to defeat you, you find a weapon, you can not pick up the weapon because the game lags out HARD (no matter the internet connection), you die to someone who had ""server luck"" on their side and actually picked up a weapon. * You try to remain stealthy and silent so people don't spot you, you die because someone followed you by seeing your bugged out weapon models randomly hanging in the air on the path you took before. * You get shot at, you see who it is and hide behind a big ass rock. You are perfectly hidden, the guy doesn't see you and shoots at the air near the rock, you die because these shots hit you. (Confirmed with death-cam) * You run into a guy, blast a shotgun right into his chest/face at close range, (blood shows confirming you hit him) but somehow he's perfectly fine, shoots you and kills you, you check the death cam - his HP remained full all the time.

The streamers and the developers. Arguably, the streamers are the ones that made this game famous but as of right now, they are ruining it with the help of the developers.  ""There are two rules for success... Number one, never reveal everything you know.""  The Streamer. These are the people who cry and whine about stream sniping. I have to be completely honest, I feel sorry for these guys... If you're going to complain about stream snipers then whine to the developers otherwise you're not going to play their game anymore, you need to shut up and get out. The laziness and the ""♥♥♥♥ YOU, GIVE ME MONEY!"" attitude from the streamers disgust me the most. They could easily put up a delay, blur out information, and block out the map... they choose not to. Instead, this is where the devs come into play...   With very little to no proof at all, they will ban you outright because a streamer cried stream sniper. In fact, the devs don't even need proof, the streamers' tears and butthurt emotions show all the proof that he's a salty loser. You guys need to listen to the real community, the Steam reviews, the people on Reddit. Not to the dumbasses who stream and cry ""STREAM SNIPER, BAN HIM!"" whenever they get salty about being killed. At this point, there are possibly more innocent people banned than actual stream snipers. Go for the real problems, the hackers, the exploiters, and This is completely unacceptable and you guys are sucking the streamer's ♥♥♥♥♥.   you guys need to man up and tell these guys to ♥♥♥♥ off.  if you got killed because you couldn't bother to hide important information, you're an idiot and you have no right to complain.",226.4,Not Recommended,8982

578080,2020-09-01 00:00:00,"Playing PUBG is like going to an amusement park and waiting in line for 2.5 hours in the blazing hot sun to ride your favorite roller coaster. Except that when the ride finally starts - someone shoots you in the face, steals all of your stuff, and tells you how much you suck at riding roller coasters.  98% of your time is spent walking across the map, punctuated by occasionally getting shot at and using cool real world tactics. It's the serious adult's version of Fortnight without the ability to build forts.  If you've got a decent graphics card, the game looks pretty great. The gameplay is heavily sound focused, but to a fault sometimes because your footsteps inside buildings can be heard by people queuing for the next round on a different server.  The game attempts to be as realistic as possible, while being sometimes hilarious. You can drive vehicles that are as loud as your footsteps in buildings, and there's a glider you can fly too which is pretty fun. Weapon drops are a fools errand and the cosmetics are... odd.  Most of the serious players don't wear shoes and play as females - because I don't know why. Maybe bare feet make less noise, but bare feet isn't realistic so I have no idea what's up with that.  There is a training mode which I highly recommend because one of the most important aspects of getting good at this game is the ability to switch your loadout on the fly to adapt to whatever situation you're in. Encumbrance is kindof ignored, which is counter to the realism but that's neither here nor there so just look the other way.  It's a squad based game, but you can play solo as well. If you play in a squad as a noob, most people will be pretty nice to you, but are usually super serious. Communication is crucial in this game, so learn how to do proper call-outs and use the compass. Oh, and whatever you do, NEVER refer to customizing your weapons as ""crafting"". They very very much hate that.  Also there's this thing called 'thirsting' which means that if you incapacitate someone you're expected to go after their teammates instead of just killing the person you incapacitated. Apparently this is a noob tactic and serious players will get mad at you for doing it. I just kill them anyway because I just spent 2.5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hours waiting for the roller coaster drop and you can eat my butt if you think I'm not going to shoot you in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ face while you're down.  Another bonus is that since the weapons are 'real world' you get to learn all the cool gun jargon.  It will take you 100 hours to get the basics, then another 2000 hours to get decent. There are some great youtube tutorials to make that first 100 hours less traumatic.  I got second place once, so that was cool.",249.5,Recommended,194
578080,2020-08-02 00:00:00,"After having spend a few hours with playing PUBG (more than 2000 to be exact), it's time to review the game. Even with the bugs, lags, cheaters and game crashes in the middle of a match, playing PUBG was a lot of fun.  With the shrinking number of players, the percentage of cheaters and hackers got higher and higher. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as a reward are now limited to ranked matches. No one can be surprised about all the cheaters at ranked matches. If you want to play ranked matches, you need to add a phone number to the game. This doesn't stop chinese players from playing at EU servers. How do I know they're chinese? Chinese names (some have chinese streamer site names), China exclusive skins, they talk chinese, ... . I played a ranked match at Sanhok with 7 players left. Me hiding behind a rock and 2 chinese teams remained. They were teaming and cheating. I saved the replay. They were one big team. After they killed everyone else, they ran to my rock and one of them was already shooting at the rock from great distance.  If you make it to the top 10 at ranked mode games (EU Servers), you can read a lot of chinese player names. The PUBG developers want the game to be an esports game. Therefore ranked matches must be region locked! No local sports league accepts players / teams that are located at other parts of the world. Chinese players in a european or an american ranking make no sense.  Free weekends are not increasing the number of casual / normal players but the number of cheaters. If cheaters get a permanent ban, they buy a new copy of the game or they get a few copies at a sale. This only puts more money into that blue hole. If they don't work on the cheater problem, the game will loose even more casual and normal players. The number of normal players has decreased dramaticly. About 95% of the players that I'm following (they were good teammates) are no longer playing PUBG.  The game needs a region lock. I'd rather wait 10 Minutes for the next game than playing with cheaters. Cheaters should get a hardware ban. There should be a server reserved for all the cheaters. Let 'em play against each other all season long and add some extremly good bots. After having a hard time, they should get their ban information at the end of the season (instead of skins).  As long as PlayClaw 5 is running on my PC, PUBG won't start. I used to film my PUBG matches with PlayClaw 5 and upload good matches to YouTube.  The developers even managed to ruin one of their best maps. Adding more roads and railroads to the Vikendi map completely ruined the map.  Thanks to PUBGs development, I realised that I should spend a lot more time on my other favorite games and less time with PUBG. I guess I never spend as much time in such a short time as I did with PUBG. For a few months I wasn't playing any other game and I also bought a few season passes.  This review will change to a recommendation if the cheater problem gets solved.  Feel free to visit my Steam Curator Page:   I filmed a few cheaters, like this one:",2720.8,Not Recommended,143
578080,2021-01-18 00:00:00,"Alright, let me preface this by saying this game WAS fun. This game made my 2018-2019 and I've played so much over the years but in it's current state I cannot recommend it to new players. It seems as though everyone who used to play this game to mess around with their friends have since moved on to other games which means the only people left playing this game are level 500 crackheads who will 99% of the time overpower you in combat. The playerbase is just left with this and while winning is still possible, you probably won't have much fun while trying to win. My next big issue is the developers and their Map design/Map queue choices. Seriously, why can't I queue individual maps that aren't event based. I genuinely hate trying to get into miramar or erangel just to be thrown into Sanhok which I believe is objectively the worst map in the game. This leads me to my other point - these maps SUCK! I cannot stand the map design of Sanhok because it sends you into a 100 player lobby with such small space to work with on top of the color palette that makes spotting players much more of a challenge (although this could be viewed as a positive, I think it makes the map unbearably boring). In my opinion the maps other than Miramar and Erangel are just less enjoyable overall because they just kept downscaling the maps to the point where we now have Haven - the 1 by 1 crack shack. This really wouldn't be an issue if I could queue for individual maps. I really do love this game and it's given me a lot of fond memories and I hate to say it but the experience isn't worth 30 dollars and trying to get into the game now is gonna be hell. If you're looking for battle royale then play Warzone or Apex Legends and if you want a game to play with friends to have a good time I can't say this is the one anymore.

578080,2018-11-02 00:00:00,"Somehow this game got worse over time. It had less issues in early access.  The OC servers haven't worked in months. When asked about it they blatantly removed the OC servers, and now you don't get a choice for which region you want to connect to. So as someone in who lives in Australia, I'm forced to play on servers in Asia or the USA with higher latency.  Then there's the general gameplay bugs. You can easily clip on something while driving and then your vehicle is destroyed. This type of bug has never been fixed.  Other random collision issues on objects when shooting, sometimes you think your shot should clear an object, but because a collision model wasn't done correctly, the bullet will hit something else. Especially prevalent around window frames, the top of fences and walls.  The general player base is terrible. There is no region filter, so a lot of people get stuck with players who don't speak the same language. I've been demanded by Chinese players to speak Chinese on an Australian server.  These are some basic ideas that should have been implemented at the start back in early access.  1. Have a language preference. You should be able to select your native language, and get paired with other people on the same team who speak your language. This will solve the issue of having team mates you can't communicate with.  2. Default to the server with the lowest ping, but also give the choice for server selection.  3. The ability to report bugs through the player death cam. You can only report cheating in the current state of the game.  Please don't give this company your money. They don't deserve it.  I do like the concept of a battle royale game, but I'm sure another company will do a much better job. This is what happens when you only care about money instead of improving your product.

I will write an honest, unbiased review based off of my gameplay experience and thank you for taking the time to read my review.  *For the sake of the review I will include the whole entity of PUBG (head company/developers/publishers) when I mention ""PUBG""*  Going back a few years, I spent a good amount of time in DAYZ:SA. I really enjoyed the loot/survival aspect, but the game was being developed far too slowly and I was ready to move on. I hopped on the Battlegrounds train while it was in the beta stage and I was impressed. In the midst of a growing market of battle royale games I decided to give my time and money to PUBG because I anticipated a lot of great content. Normally I pray the rosary at the thought of ""early access"" games and throw holy water on pre-orders, but after reading several great reviews I wanted to see what the hype was about. From conception to release, the game seemed to grow exponentially and everything was going great. They even had 2 crates, Suvivor and Wanderer, that you didn't need a case key to open. Was this CD PROJEKT RED manifesting in a different form? Everything was going well until the introduction of paid crates.  The core things I like about PUBG at this moment in time are: *Diversity of weapons *Diversity of attachments *Character agility (vaulting/jumping/crouching/prone/swimming) *Vehicular maneuverability *Vehicular diversity *Access to every building, making it feel immersive  The core things I dislike about PUBG at this moment in time are: *Clientside lag *High ping players being grouped with low/moderate ping players *Paid Crates/skins *Bluehole trying to scrape as much money before the game capsizes *Useless weapons (crowbar/machete)  To me, this game feels like a cash grab. Instead of fixing their netcode, separating players based off of ping, and developing a structured game, PUBG does the opposite. It caters to a younger audience that doesn't know any better about the prinicples of gambling, attempts defaming Fortnite instead of taking some ideas and implementing them in a better way, and bases the game off of an economy. Anything that is based off of economic gain, and content not in the interest of customers, on a fundamental level WILL collapse. Once the economy runs dry, so do the developers and the trend follows all the way through to the top, whereas the opposite will happen if you keep your customers happy. What's more upsetting is the ""FIX PUBG"" button in the menu on the top right once the game loads. It is up to the developers to create, patch, and improve a game while listening to the player. Instead I get the feeling that our concerns go in one ear and out the other while continuing to release new crates/skins/clothes.  Dean Hall promised so many fans a working DAYZ:SA, but once he reached his financial goal, he ran and left the DAYZ:SA corpse to rot in someone else's hands. History repeats itself.  Vote with your wallet. Do not support this game or any others that are more interested in your hard earned money than they are interested in giving you a fun, memorable experience.

578080,2018-03-11 00:00:00,"Edit 2018.03.31: yes, i played 300hrs in the game and enjoyed quite a large percentage of those. that definitely feels like a game i should give a big thumbs up to. but in the end, a review should reflect how you feel about a game after playing it. i've played games for 1-2 hours and loved them and will have fond memories of years later (Timeframe) so # of hours is not a very interesting metric.  i've always enjoyed milsims and PUBG really hit the sweet spot there. i wanted this game to be where i spend my most precious resource: my time. i think we all agree that the potential for PUBG to be the ultimate serious FPS Battle Royale was there but has been squandered because the game is so frustrating to play at high level. with that in mind, here's the original review:  it feels weird to be thumb downing such a popular game which i myself played for over 300 hours, enjoyed with friends, had some unforgettably entertaining moments in, and whose best players i watched often on twitch when unable to play myself.  however, thumbs down it is and the game has been uninstalled.  when i got the game in september of last year it was a hot [relatively] new thing with amazing potential and it was forgivable to have all the wonky issues (desync, start game lag, etc). since then, the early access game has gone gold, introduced a new map, added cosmetics and taunts, changed balance in weapons, addressed cheats, etc. the dev team has definitely been busy and adding a lot of content and interest to the game.  the problem? the foundation on which pubg is built hasn't changed. at this point, given the focus of the dev team, this signals to me that it will likely change.  the devs attempted to fix the start of game lag by redistributing starting player locations and removing pre-game items. to me this is a clear indication that the basic problem in the engine hasn't been addressed, just worked around. the client to client discrepancies due to architecture decisions made early in the development process now seem unlikely to be addressed in the future.  ask yourself how many times the pubg engine misrepresents player positions and angles when a kill happens. the likelihood is that more often than not someone [typically the one on the receiving end ;)] is shaking their head and it doesn't have anything to do with their reactions to what they see in the game.  as a comparison, take the decade old source engine that drives counter strike global offensive. you can complain all you want about that game but the base it is built on is incredibly solid. the surprises at every level of play have to do with player skill, not engine quirks.  when TSM_Viss returned from IEM Katowice 2018 in march - having played PUBG only on LAN and not online for several days he had this to say: :  ""after playing on LAN you come back to this, you guys have no idea how much lag we play with constantly in this game [...] if they could get the game feeling like how it feels on LAN, online, ho-my-god. it would be a dream.""  it's 2018.  2 decades since Quake World set the bar for responsiveness in online games you simply can't have an action FPS run on an engine that must allow as much unreliability as PUBG and with no signs of that ever being addressed.",343.2,Not Recommended,1707

This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired. You're done!

578080,2020-07-12 00:00:00,"After 940 hours played, there's nothing I can say that everyone wouldn't know already, but I'm saying it anyways because I wanna let it out.  pros: -good ideas, teamwork, semi-realistic gunplay, easy to learn, hard to master, the maps are now diverse enough and plentiful to provide endless amount of variation in combat situations. cons: geez, where do I begin? -horrible netcode (random lags, frequent packet loss and high latency, no, not my ISP, on some servers there are no issues, also sometimes higher latency players have the advantage, go on youtube, look it up, I kid you not.) A lot of weird situations and inexplicable phenomena around the circumstances of some deaths we were involved in. Equipment left floating in the air from a player's back. Objects stuck halfway in the floor. This may be map design-related, but not always occurring, I'd say sync issues. -constantly changing weapon stats, game balance changes that are hard to follow -CHEATERS, HACKERS and the lack of a ranking system (I know they implemented the ranked mode with an SMS-confirmation security measure, but what that did is invite more cheaters and hackers, you get to compete with people on any skill level and your only option is the unranked mode where you get very-very stupid bots to fill up servers to reduce waiting time in addition to the aforementioned cheaters and hackers, for which plague the PUBG Corporation has yet to find a cure) -very poor performance of the game itself, UE4 is capable of way better performance than what is presented here, it is just baffling how your frame rate can drop from 90 to 30 in a jiffy for no apparent reason. But how about fortnite? that's the same Unreal Engine 4, it still performs better with smaller but denser maps, but with less amount of fps fluctuation.  and the hairsplitting parts if the above con list would be all hammered out in a perfect world, there are still these things:  -adding stupid or useless features or features implemented goofily or in an illogical way hiding them behind ""game balance"" (talking about the picatinny rail on the micro uzi and the thompson (but you can't even put a 2x scope on them although it would be physically possible to do so, also stupid that you can't attach all grips to the vector) and most likely because they almost solely listen to e-sports competitors as far as advice goes regarding gameplay balance changes. -overly simplified, but still manages to be convoluted weapon upgrade and attachment system that defies real life logic and only applies to the game because ""balance"", again (this and that type of muzzle device attachable to this and that type of a weapon regardless of barrel type, caliber, whether it is threaded or not. the same goes for extended mags, removed pistol extended mags because noone used them, but now you can stuff an mp5 mag into any kind of pistol, I could go on...) -I get the idea of simplifying ammo and calibers, it is still funny and silly how you are using 7.62x39mm ammo stuffed inside a nagant revolver chambered for and designed around the 7.62x38mmR cartridge which has a way thinner case and rimmed, you wouldn't be able to stuff that in an M1895's cylinder ever. Also if you put a 9x39 subsonic and a 9x19 parabellum side by side you would see why it is also silly to assume that a VSS could chamber a 9mm pistol bullet... hairsplitting? yes. but look:  I could go on with the K98's ammo and some others, but I'm done for now :) -very silly skins (clothing, equipment and weapon skins, also I'd throw the car skins in as well. I can imagine this being fun to most people, I would only want options of my taste like camo clothing, but I know, it's an unfair advantage, but hey, if you wanna run around in a clownsuit, that's on you. I'd still prefer at least some one-colored tan or olive green pants and tops. nothing fancy. -lack of vehicle damage model. this is self-explanatory  This is what has been accumulating for all these years we've been playing this game, we still do because, unfortunately, there is no viable alternative that would offer similar game experience with realistic-ish weapons, first person view, similar gameplay with simple battle royale rules, so we're stuck with this game that has been really rolling, or rather flying downhill for a good half a year now",1604.2,Not Recommended,186

It was a fun experience with some nice tweaks and changes from its other battle royale predecessors. I've given this game a ton of chances but Bluehole continues to destroy their own community with bad game play mechanics and poorly planned ""Season Pass"" missions that, once you've paid 13$ to get the pass, give you absolutely nothing unless you play the game non-stop, 24/7, for a month or two or be forced to buy level up packs to unlock the items you thought you just bought with the ""Season Pass"". The absolute shadiest scam I have seen in the gaming industry in a long time. I have no problem with having to work for my items, but level 70+ is next to unobtainable without purchasing extra levels and of course those are the only skins that are worthwhile. While I'm on the topic of ""Season Pass"" missions, who thought it would be a good idea to make a mission to drive a Mirado for 2 hours? On a map that you can literally wait 20 minutes in queue (both squad and duo queues) and still not get a Miramar game on NA servers. Not only that but when you do get a squad game on Miramar with any random people in the group, that random person is guaranteed to be driving around the outside of the map in his Mirado making it a 3 on 4 for the rest of the game. Great way to support team play and meet new people in the community /eyeroll.  Bluehole has improved very few of it's major glaring flaws since it's beta but you can be sure it'll keep on updating those textures as well as those $5USD/ea character skins. The enemy hit-boxes are a complete joke and don't reflect where the characters actually are on your screen because the servers are just sad for a 40$ game with a boatload of in-game purchases. If you play on NA servers, Bluehole likes to schedule their updates between 6:30pm to 1:00 or 2:00am EST most nights. If any sort of update is launched (even a 20 Mb anti cheat update), be prepared for about 3 hours of ""SERVERS ARE BUSY"" messages if you try to log in. I guess even with all that money they still haven't been able to figure out how to properly launch an update from a second server that doesn't knock out the dedicated game servers or purchase proper bandwidth for their game.  With a game like Apex Legend that just came out for free, where you can REALISTICALLY grind upgrades, skins and character unlocks without even having to pay a penny, I give this game less that a year before its dead in the water and you can't find a match even if you wanted to.

578080,2024-06-12 00:00:00,"The Tiananmen Square protests, known in China as the June Fourth Incident,[1][2][a] were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, China, lasting from 15 April to 4 June 1989. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts between the demonstrators and the Chinese government to find a peaceful resolution, the Chinese government declared martial law on the night of 3 June and deployed troops to occupy the square in what is referred to as the Tiananmen Square massacre. The events are sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement, the Tiananmen Square Incident,[c] or the Tiananmen uprising.The protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy that benefited some people but seriously disadvantaged others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge to its legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,[5] and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for things like rollback of the removal of ""iron rice bowl"" jobs, greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. Workers' protests were generally focused on inflation and the erosion of welfare. These groups united around anti-corruption demands, adjusting economic policies, and protecting social security.At the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the square.",43.5,Recommended,420

Currently, the game is still a classic and has managed to (mostly) maintain a very refreshing gritty and maximalist gaming experience in a sea of modern day hyper-saturated, kid friendly shooter games. This game is difficult and demanding, as some matches in the full-sized maps can take up to 30min+. I strongly recommend you play this game with a team of friends, in third person in one of the old full-sized maps (Erangel or Mira Mar). Aside from all the positives I've listed, I do wish this game remained true to its roots, instead of (in some ways) Fortnit-efying the game (emotes, skins, dances, colourful maps, etc).

578080,2018-04-18 00:00:00,"I was one of the early birds for downloading this game when it was first made public for testing. This game had/has a lot of potential. When it started off the mechanics, and game play design were quite fun and intriguing. However, over the last 6 months, they have taken what promised to be a fun very challenging game, and basically buried it under a pile of money.  What do I mean by that? Well let me explain. They have taken a fun game that millions of people have spent their hard earned cash to purchase, and turned it into a game that caters to the cheaters, and hackers. The developers have turned a blind eye to those of us who want to play a fair game. In order to play this game we ALL had to drop a few bucks for the original purchase price which I believe is $29.99. Multiply that my 3-5 million sold, and we have made this company very, very wealthy.  Now as with any popular game, the cheaters, and hackers went right to work developing ways to get the advantage over those of us who use actual skill to play. Once they developed numerous cheats, and hacks, they started selling those to the not so honest gamer. Those gamer's then flood the game with their not so covert hacks, and they run around the map using either speed hacks, wall hacks or the most popular no recoil hack.  In the beginning it was rare for me to be killed by one of these cheaters, as there were not to many of them. My first experience was with my crew of 4, all of whom are experienced high level 1st person shooter veterans like myself. We have been playing fps together for many years, and have been ranked top in the world on many platforms. That day we were near Severny on the original map, all 4 of us were headed to one of the bunkers just outside of town. Upon reaching the entrance one of my crew was dropped by a head shot from a 45 pistol. None of us had seen or heard anyone else near us. As he yelled into his mic for us to back him up, we all turned to head towards him, that's when we all saw our 1st blatant cheater. This person ran past us moving at the speed of a Dacia at full throttle, and as he buzzed a circle around us, he fired just 3 rounds from his 45, each round striking each of our team in the head.  Needless to say none of us were to pleased to have spent the last 30 minutes of our time to get into the top ten left alive, only to have some unskilled looser rob us of a fun time. Now keep in mind we had all played for many hours at this point, and had only heard talk of cheaters, never had we experienced one, until then.  Since that day, the number of cheaters have risen to a point that I can say with a strong belief, that every single round played now has 1 to 30 people per round using outside software to enhance there game, to a point that even highly skilled players cannot compete with. Why haven't the developers done anything about this you might ask. Well they have, they have done very little to be honest.  They have banned a few million people for cheating already, but it is not a permanent ban, that person can create a new steam account, pay for the game again, and start over. But why would someone want to risk being banned, and then have to pay another $29.99 to get back in you might wonder. Well that's simple to explain as well. The company who created this game gets extra revenue, because they allow the once banned to repurchase another game, so they make more money that way. But its not the only way the company profits from these cheaters. The cheaters play as long as they can before they get banned, which is historically anywhere from a month to 3 months.  During that time they rack up massive amounts of BP (in game fake money) that they then use to buy crates in the game. These crates contain skins for weapons, cloths, shoes, etc. Some crates you get, require a key to open them. The only way you can get a key is to purchase one from the company for real currency. Therefore making them even more profit. There is a real world demand for these items, and people sell them on the open marketplace for cash. Some items are worth over $1000 real world cash. So the longer the cheaters can stay in the game before they get banned, the more BP they acquire, and the more money they spend to buy keys. Then they turn around and sell the items they get on the marketplace, and make REAL money. Therefore the cheaters make more than enough to cover another game once they get banned, and the company gets richer. The only losers in this setup are the real gamer's, who mistakenly bought this game to challenge themselves, and to have fun.  The Creators of this game have no intention of making it cheater, and hacker free, as that will lower the overall income they get. Lets face the facts,they wont get rich off of the not so honest players like they are now. Don't expect them to do anything more than they already are. They will make a big deal about how many people they banned in the last big sweep of catching cheaters, just like the last 6-7 times they have made this anouncment. But if you notice, and pay close attention, they only do that every few months. That way they give the cheaters time to profit so they can buy back in again before they run another ban sweep. Its all about the money to these people, not a single one gives a (*&^ about the real gamer's.  The game used to be a blast, but now its a joke. I know that I, and many others will not waste our money on any games this company puts out in the future. They have proven themselves to be as worthless to the honest player as the hackers are. Don't waste your time, or money on this game. Unless you have low morals and want to make a profit from cheating, then this is a great game for you!",1836.6,Not Recommended,1503

578080,2020-12-05 00:00:00,"ORIGINAL REVIEW - Dec, 4, 2020:  Let me just say that I bought this game back when it was in Early Access.  When my friends and I first began playing the game, it was actually not bad. We enjoyed the game a lot and like the amount of realism the game had to offer other than what Fortnite offered. Needless to say, the grind it took to just get to that Chicken Dinner took literal hours. It really was not an easy goal, but we did get there a few times. Most of the time, we'd be goofing off having fun with the bugs each update introduced and even then we'd still try and fight for the most kills. The only maps at the time were the original Erangel, Miamar, and I believe they just introduced Sanhok, though I may be wrong. Every game was consistent and we enjoyed all the moments we had in it. With the exception of hackers occasionally ruining the game, but they were taken care of most of the time from what we noticed.  Now that was back in 2017. Fast forwarding to today, 2020.  This game SUCKS. It seems like they added so much into the game that wasn't necessary AT ALL. Not only was the amount of content just overwhelming, they basically just threw in the towel to the hackers and simply stopped banning them from the looks of it. Even now, the lobbies are so empty, they are now adding bots to fill in the spaces!? Like, excuse me? This is a battle royale hunger games type deal, NOT A SIMULATION OF ONE. (Well, I mean it's kind of a simulation of one cause it's not real life, but you get the idea.) The game is dead, the company (who isn't Bluehole anymore mind you) doesn't care about the community anymore and just cares about profits, and the game is buggier than ever!  Don't play this game if you also want to be banned for absolutely no reason. Go play Apex Legends or Fortnite. It's not worth spending your money on this piece of garbage when there's two really good free to play games on the market right now.  ------  EDIT - May 1, 2023:  So after putting the game off for three years, a few friends and I decided to pick it back up and see if anything had changed. Now some have been good, some... not so good. First, let's go over the good things.  Good/Bad - HACKERS:  It seems within the last three years, they've somewhat solved the hacker issue to some degree. While playing the game, my friends and I have barely run into any hackers. We still run into them on occasion but it's not as prevalent as it used to be back in 2020. We now usually see a hacker maybe once every 100 rounds or something to that. It's still not fun to get gunned down by one, but it seems it's somewhat solved for the most part from our experience.  Bad/Good - CUSTOM LOBBIES:  We finally have the option to do custom lobbies which we've honestly been having more fun with than the actual games themselves. Usually there's about 8-15 of us in a round and we just either goof off, battle one another, deathmatch, or whatever the case maybe. It's been really fun to just have a playful battle between friends all together and it leads to some fun banter, especially if we just use the in-game proximity chat. Now the bad thing about these lobbies is that you cannot put bots in to fill the spaces. We all have wanted to do a 100 man custom lobby battle royale, but due to us not being able to put bots in, it limits us to only being able to play smaller maps and rounds take longer. Not to mention, finding your friends on the battle field is next to impossible on the big maps.  Bad - CASUAL ROUNDS  PUBG has the option where you can do casual games. Instead of the whole lobby being filled with normal players, it's instead filled with bots, with three other real player squads in the round. Personally, I don't mind the bots since they're so easy to kill. My biggest issue is the fact that these lobbies are not only locked to only 3 a day, but it's also the place where we seem to find the hackers. It should be as it states, ""CASUAL."" A lobby where you should go guns blazing on the AI and not have to deal with other players or hackers ruining the fun. There shouldn't be a limit on how many you have a day. They should either get rid of it, or change it to adapt it better into the game.  Other than that, I still don't recommend this game to the highest degree, but it seems to have gotten better. Just don't throw your money at the game.",575.6,Not Recommended,248

578080,2020-01-24 00:00:00,"So finally it has come to this. After nearly 1000h I am finally done with this steaming pile of s**t game.  For the clueless: This game has pretty much not improved since its early access status. At one time it was so bad, that there was a ""fix pubg"" campaign. This campaign has since vanished for the dumbest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason I have ever heard from a game studio.  Fixing the errors was just too hard.  Instead we get more uninspired cosmetics with either a stupendously low chance of getting them from the LOOT BOXES (yeah you heard me), or incedibly irrational prices in the shop.  The graphics are just not next gen, the textures especially seem really low quality. Some might say I just did not crank the graphics high enough, which is an entirely valid assumption, given the fact that i can barely play it on high settings with my GTX 1070. Which brings me to my next point:  The developers are totally clueless and this is one of the worst optimized games I have ever played. I can play CoD Modern Warfare (the new one) on highest graphics and it doesnt even use as much of my graphics card, while still looking magnitudes better than this brick of a game  What finally pushed me over the edge was the recent decision of replacing my favourite map Vikendi with a 2kmx2km map, on which still 64 players drop. This has managed to take most of the skill out of the game for me, because you start off in a sandwich situation, looting a double barrel shotgun, while getting blasted with automatic rifles from 4 different directions. If youre not lucky enough to loot the right weapon for your situation nearly instantly, thats it for that round. Dying to terrible timing is now 10 times more likely.  That was the final straw.

Please read another review if you are looking for opinions on any recent issues. Otherwise, I am leaving the review as is for the time period and will edit it if I return.   This game is incredibly enjoyable, exciting and gets my adrenaline rushing like nothing I've ever played....  BUT, until the devs stop banning people because streamers say they were ""harassed"", I'm giving it a thumbs down.  Devs, honking a horn is NOT harassment. Explain to me how that effects someones stream or is harassment? Kill the person if they're doing that, and if they're in your squad, don't play with that person again (DUH). Also, when you're constantly being thrown into random servers, the odds of actually ""stream sniping"" someone is virtually impossible. This isn't like other games where you can find the server name and follow the streamer into it. Who the hell made this decision?  Also, the broken promise regarding microtransactions. That is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shady. That's bad enough, but when there are so many glaring areas that need work, ignoring all of that to add a feature you said you wouldn't add until release is a straight kick in the nuts to your supporters.  Devs, don't forget: We made you successful, and we can undo that by choosing not to buy anymore games from someone who isn't trustworthy, and thinks prioritizing streaming to the point of BANNING legitimate players who may not even be aware the other person is streaming is INSANITY. Whoever made this decision needs to be FIRED.  You guys have created a PR nightmare for yourself and until you make it right it's only going to get worse. It's like you started out with a row boat and now you're flying around in a Yacht. Except now you decided to blow a hole in the bottom of the yacht, allowing it to take on water (which will inevitably sink it), but you choose to pretend the hole isn't there and that you didn't make it.

578080,2018-02-28 00:00:00,"I have been a player, or gamer, since I have memory. I have owned and played so many games in my life, and it became one of my favorite hobbies, probably the most favorite one.  PUBG was not an exception. I got this game thanks to a close friend who I played with at least half of the hours I spent on this game. We never were ""good players"" at all, and we never even got a chicken dinner. I got one tho, in DUO with a random two months ago. I was a bad player, or should I say, a regular player of this game, who barely made it to top 10, and also who died more than killed. I was a player like you, and like anyone else. I just played this for fun, like I do with the rest of my games.  Which means I used to launch this game, put my headphones on and let the fun begin. Simple as that. No drama.  And then, suddenly a morning I see on my steam profile a Game block warning, after almost four years of being an user here, and a constant online player ( as you can see on my profile, most of the games I own are multiplayer, because that is the kind of games I like).  I got worried. I had no idea what was going on. I lightly punched my face to check if it was a nightmare.  But it was not. It was real. I got a game block, a ban, a red big signal on my profile saying I had a game block.  ""What the ****"" I said. I checked as soon as I could from which game was this game block.  It was PUBG. Devs of pubg decided to give a permanent ban as February gift. Back then I thought it was all a mistake, that it was going to be fixed. There was no way I could have been banned just like that, not with my stats, not with my record, my pc was clean as an empty recycle bin, I made sure of it using Malwarebytes, Rkill, and so other softwares. The only software that runs in my background is Glasswire to track my network usage since I run a limited internet service and you can find it on Steam itself.  ""Why on earth would I be banned on this game, and WHY on this game? I played last night just fine and didnt got any BattleEye warning or anything similar, besides, its not the only online game I play. Glasswire couldnt have been the responsible"" I said.  Nothing was out of the ordinary, my pc was fine, my internet was fine, the rest of my games were working good with their anticheat systems (Vac, BattleEye, EasyAntiCheat, and so many others) even though, I was still banned on PUBG, it was a fact, it was real.  So I decided to send them a email reporting the missunderstanding. I needed to know a reason why. I needed them to know it was a mistake.  My email was answered two days after that. It was a pre-generated email from PUBG, and it was pretty obvius since I made some contact with other people who was in the same boat as me. I asked them what PUBG answered them, they sent me exactly the same message I got.  ""If you have any concerns answer this email"" Said at the end of their email.  I had a lot of concerns, of course I had. So I wrote them back and I am still waiting for a more proper answer.  Probably I will never get an answer. Why would they answer? They are rich already, I would not be surprised if they simply ignore the email. Fun fact is that even they are billionaire by this point they cant afford a proper customer service.  As for today, I am still banned. Many of my friends texted me on Steam asking me what happened to me. ""Were you hacking all this time?"" A guy from CSGO said to me.  I answered him ""Seems like being a loser at a game means you are hacking. No way you can be THAT bad. You must be hacking"" He laughed off so bad.  I feel sorry for my friend who got this game for me specially to play with me, and we had so much fun together, but for 30$ I expected a better customer service. I feel sorry for myself too. I lost hours of my life in a game that ended treating me as a hacker, as a customer who does not have the right to have a proper reason why he was banned.  I feel sorry for what the gaming Industry has become.  I am not the first or last to be unfairly banned on PUBG. Already met with couple people who are in the same position, and just like me, they havent got any proper reason stating why they were banned.  While I am banned, ""ChingChong4XXDestroyer"" is at the top 10 in the leaderboard, with more kills than deaths, and of course, all of them being headshots from lot of meters away.

What absolutely and irrefutably CANNOT be excused is when the cheating and server latency made this game completely unplayable, the developers went completely radio silent, made no efforts to improve their game, and even went as far as to monetize the game further by adding PAID LOOT BOXES AND KEYS into the game at a time when it had reached its worst.

HOWEVER, there are tons of bugs. Recently, they decided to release a ""gift"" to their playerbase as an apology for all the bugginess that has been problematic. BUT, there was a bug, for their apology for their bugs. Funny right? To make everything worse, they decided to punish the playerbase for this new bug. Because they accidentally gave out an extra 20k BP (in game currency), they decided to just take it away from the people that received extra. Because I spent it on in game grates, I now have almost negative 20k BP.  This doesn't bother me too much, in terms of the in game repercussions of not being able to buy crates. But I think it really reflects how this game's company treats its playerbase. To use such a petty move, to punish the playerbase for their own mistakes, truly reflects how low they have stooped.  The game is still buggy as ever, if not more. I constantly crash, whether at the lobby of the game, or loading in to a game. This makes it hard to play with my squad, because someone always crashes loading in, leading us all to have to back out. Assuming someone doesn't crash loading back in to the game, we would have to qeue up for another game hoping we don't crash in the process.  Anyways, those are just my thoughts. It feels as if the game is not making any forward progress, and new updates are centered around trying to make microtransactions more integrated.

578080,2017-04-29 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW TL;DR - It's unparalleled by other titles like it. But so are the performance issues. Buy it, try it, and refund if meh.  ""So today's lesson is - you kill each other off till there's only one left. Nothing's against the rules.""  Battle Royale was my biggest dread throughout my teens. I watched it with friends around the turn of the 20th century, fell in love with it but was convinced that it'd really happen at some point. Mum would ship me off to an island full of murderous youths and I'd never see the light of day. At 5'4"" and less than 7 stone, I was scared I might have to pimp myself off to random horny guys so I could slice their necks as they tried to rip my knickers off. Boy was I dark teen. Given that I got so immersed in the idea of dystopian survival you'd reckon I'd have played more survival arena games, but no. This is the first time I've felt like I've found an actual ""Battle Royale"" game that I enjoy and am excited to play. Despite my freakish intoxication with simulated high stress survival environments, no game has felt like I was ""in"" Battle Royale. This feels like I'm playing the media franchise. I love it to tiny ripped shreds as I scream with intervals of girly giggling, blood splattered all over my face.  Spawning on an island that moonlights as a lobby, population 100, you can practice combat using weapons available at set locations most easily obtained when joining early (±35P). The island has nooks and crannies to explore but most games start within 1-2 minutes of entry thanks to the current massive inflow of players. You can see this lobby/island on the far right corner of your map and actually return there once you start a match if you want. It's really meta... Once the game starts you'll sit in a plane with everyone else and parachute to your area of choice on a much larger island (aka Erangel). You loot buildings and other players (after killing them) for gear/weapons/consumables (buff) and drive all over the island in the process while keeping an eye on the safe zone that exponentially shrinks until there's only one surviving player/team. Get caught outside it too long and your health will plummet quicker than a suicidal anchor.  Writing about popular games always bears with it the possibility of sounding like a broken record. You already know the negatives, the positives and the performance tribulations from the countless reviews and forum posts. To top it off the game is in EA, each patch bringing along a band of changes voiding the initial points within previous reviews. Transposing from strategy to action, the sub genre is inconstant. In one patch the former glorious ascendancy of strategy was forcefully removed, whittling the mind blowing chessboard it started as down to headstrong tactics only because of a slight shift in quality weapons loot placement and its spawn rate. It's since been revamped with higher percentage of crate drops and loot. The smallest changes make you choose divergent plays from one patch to the next. It went from mostly strategy to mostly twitch shooter in a single patch and then backed up towards a middle ground trying to maintain equilibrium. It might end up less like the initial brilliance of a Battle Royale simulator and more towards another generic arena shooter. Who knows? EA multiplayers are hard to keep alive. Unavoidably awful optimisation reeks of EA, testing the patience of most systems and players. Server side latency is fine but too often it'll fail to sync (what I see on screen = not actually happening). One thing is for certain, I'm having an insane degree of fun playing PUBG, and even if it ends up like every other heap of goo I won't regret it because it's great right the eff now. I bought it at release because it was already a well done game and pretty much complete in terms of gameplay mechanics. Running a tight ship exterminating hacks/cheats is a given and they seem to be doing relatively well. PUBG knows no other flaws.  It's potently engaging if you favour the tactical twitch shooter, and don't shy away from strategy. It's not solely for genre veterans. If you like the speed of Overwatch but love the tactics of XCOM, you'll be surprised to find yourself appreciating just how much brain power PUBG requires. If you like strategic board games such as chess or Go and FPS games as well, PUBG will ooze allure. It's less intimidating than military tactical shooters like Arma while being more serious than your run-of-the-mill survival arena. Having a blast even if you're not super into positioning and favour the run and gun approach is uncomplicated and doable. Often I'll jump into populated landing points just to have some fast fun shooting, killing and mauling people where everyone is just enjoying the game in an arcadey manner and having a riot. This game can cause uncontrollable laughter (you've been warned). Suffice to say it'll be harder to win without strategy seeing as even a good shot will run out of bullets in a 100P arena eventually. A growing majority of its players are strategic, skilled and smart enough that trolls actually burn out faster and get bored. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. I kid you not, PUBG players are the poster children of this phrase. The median skill level has risen over the past month but it's moderately easy to get into for new players even if you aren't genre familiar. Cheating isn't as prevalent as other similar games. I witnessed a blatant hack only once, nude and gliding across the grass like super speed Jesus... More serious cheats have arisen as of late but generally it's refreshingly vanilla, and is subjected to comparatively infinitesimal griefing thanks to the toil of both devs + community.  When picking this up during beta I was looking for something to replace The Division's adrenaline fueled Survival mode. The Division was a rare retreat where I had my fill of 200+ hours and suddenly felt content enough to move on. After that I sat there sucking my thumb wondering what I could do to fill the void. Along came PUBG. The only things I need to worry about here are looting, players, the shrinking field, positioning, endgame + luck. The field isn't as lethal since fatalities only come from my miscalculations and the dexterity of others. Yet PUBG understands the greatness of simplicity and it's wildly entertaining. The realism gauge is pronounced the way jumping from a fast moving vehicle will knock you down. On the other hand, I could ragdoll into oblivion by rolling down a tame hillside riding a motorcycle too fast while being able to survive multi flips of insanity like a gymnastics ribbon aiming for an Olympics gold medal, barely scathed while boosting a Dacia off a steep cliff...  . Needlessly tweaking balance like mad could leave us with Frankenstein's monster and most combat orientated multiplayer EA games on Steam don't prevail due to this. Despite the train wreck performance, it's amazingly fun and I feel like it has made me laugh the most out of any game I've ever played. With EA, people throw around the word ""potential"" like if you say it enough the game will magically nurture itself from dust. PUBG is what potential actually looks like. It's acceptably tense, wholly satisfying and loads of fun with a mate(s) or alone. Solo is mighty strategic, squad wreaks havoc and duo is the middle child. I feel dead inside when things lag, but again I've had some fantastic matches that made it all better. Also, zero simulation sickness!",154.6,Recommended,341

However, that does not mean it is unenjoyable or unplayable.  Despite my short amount of time in-game, I can confidently say is much better than it's counterpart, H1Z1 King of the Kill for a number of reasons: 1. Its weapon variety is much healthier and (somewhat) balanced in customability, strengths and weaknesses (and will evidently grow in number). 2. Some central mechanics of the game are much more realistic and less buggy in comparison to its counterpart (you can't jump out of cars that are flying at the speed of light and live; weapons actually hit where you aim, at least along the vertical axis - bullet drop is a thing!). 3. There are tons of servers already, and they are more often than not at least playable (I've only had one account of having to leave the game due to horrendous lag). 4. Graphically, it's a beautiful game at its highest settings, although it is nearly impossible to play with said settings effectively due to poor optimization, and thus FPS issues/inconsistencies. 5. The Steam Market already includes the game's in-game skins and items available to characters; another thing worth noting here is that it's relatively easy to earn ""Reward Points"" from simply playing the game. With this, you can gradually purchase crates which will randomly drop said skins. 6. The game actually feels fun and fair to play. There are a minute number of instances that feel like I was killed due to poor game design or exploitations.

578080,2018-07-19 00:00:00,"Had a bit of time in the game now so I feel semi-qualified to rate it.  The gameplay loop and idea is fun, the execution unfortunately is not and in its current state I can't recommend you get into it if you haven't already. Yeah the rush of an end game kill and chicken dinner is fun, and the gun battles (when they aren't bugging, glitching or full of hackers) can be pretty good, map design, graphics and sounds are all average to poor.  Where it really starts to go bad is in the technical aspects. The game is an absolute mess, patches break things that were already fixed and version control appears to not exist, performance zig-zags up and down depending on dozens of unknown factors (time of day, is this a ""good"" or ""bad"" patch, are the servers trash today or somehow stable, are people lagging or desyncing all over for the first 5 minutes, the most important and dangerous part of the game until the end) even my brand new i7 8700k, GTX 1080, and 16 gb ram randomly has what appear to be framerate lag issues for no reason on a brand new fresh install of windows 10 on an SSD. Meanwhile the developers work to add the next loot box or skin, trying desperately to squeeze every last drop of blood they can before the playbase disappears due to rage/burnout from the endless issues or newer better battle royale games ecplipse and destroy PUBG.  Prepare to hit invisible stuff in your car and explode, spray down enemies and never do damage, hackers to blast your head off from 400 metres away when you peaked for a less than 0.1 seconds, watch in shock and awe as your character dies seconds after rounding a corner to safety as your lag ghost gets gunned down by an enemy who could see you for extra seconds due to desync. Enjoy fun games like loot loading in after you have already run through a room giving the guy who landed seconds AFTER you a free AK47 at point blank range while you stand in amazement with a pack of bandages and a backpack as your only items, or maybe the AK DOES actually spawn but you mash ""F"" to pick it up 28 times without being able to grab it and your enemy leasurely blows you away with a hand loaded revolver he managed to pick up 8 seconds ago. Prepare to fire into the walls or roof at random when your character decides to raise his weapon or unload a mag into the windowframe because of the ""sweet"" realistic gun barrel detection. All the while new skins and packs are added by the listless developer in a desperate attempt to cash in on fanboys and kids who have free access to daddy and mommy's credit card and promises fixes which haven't come for literally years (bugs from early alpha are still in the game unfixed) Don't take my word for it though, there are streamers with 30 times the playtime I have that have endlessly documented the sad state of the game in video format.  Yes the game can be fun, yes I still play (i've invested a lot of time and its a game me and my friends all can just go and chill and play) but recommend, no I can't do that, the game is a disaster and if past attempts are any indication it will probably continue to be so indefinitely. Maybe some day the devs will use the millions upon millions of dollars earned by this monstrosity to actual make an enjoyable game that will be played for years or decades and become a classic FPS like CSGO or Rainbow 6 Seige but my hopes aren't that high based on the past track record.  All in all I can't recommend it at this time, with a lot of work and effort this could be a great game, maybe even one of the greatest, but its still so far from that state and I sadly must question if getting it to that place is even that high of a priority due to recent DLC like the battlepass and constant adding of new content when so much of the game is in desperate need of repair.

578080,2017-10-26 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW While immensely flawed from the begining, PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen before.  In spite of the bugs and shoddy servers, my friend and I put hundreds of hours into the game mostly playing Duo's, and now we consistently rank in the Top 50 players on the leaderboards.  Sadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers and Bluehole has expressed no interest whatsoever in taking serious steps to remediate the problem. Based upon the limited available evidence, it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China, and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.  While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion, it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz, Warz, and H1Z1 into irrelevancy.",690.0,Not Recommended,3181

578080,2017-04-05 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Update on the review as the changes for 10/21/2017 and prior.  Wow. Haven't updated this for 2 months and to be honest there is good reason for that. The last update i talked about how the 8/12 patch ruined the game harder than expected and well i can tell you the bugs and issues are still rising to which feels like a soon collapse.  With more and more users coming to the game no matter what due to the popularity on stream, youtube, and now even more celebs using the game while talking about it. We seen a huge rocket in users at peak. With this came issues with the crappy web page based menu which would see crashes and login errors due to massive numbers trying to use the game at once. This could be fixed by making a que system for game and at least making the menu a proper coded non-HTML mess but that is more for people who understand that sh*t to really ellaborate on as i personally am not savvy enough to talk more about it.  So along with those issues what is is wrong? You ask.  Well a lot of things. The biggest problem right now is the rise of hackers, for a good while they were there, but not very present in the world, you would bump into one at least once every 50 or more rounds (well that was what it was like for me if not even more rounds between an obvious one). Now you will see one every second game and if you are unlucky to be playing in a region plagued with them you won't go one game without some form of cheating going on in game. Battle eye is banning, which is nice, but the fact the Asian market (not all asians cheat i know and i am not saying they are, but majority come from there you have to agree) has flooded with cheaters who use the ingame battle points system to earn steam wallet then turn it into real cash allows them along with cheaper keys, allow their accounts to get banned without them batting an eye. This just means the ones who get banned will just come back with another account and cheat again so they can keep the cycle up to make money. This is the major reason why i have always been against cosmetics and market systems in games and always will be. I love cosmetics as a choice to alter your character don't get me wrong but connecting it to any market place will always make insentive for cheating, account stealing and gambling which is never a good thing for a game ever.   I still love this game but the issues are so large i can't even add them on this updated post.. i just need this game to get its sh*t together for crying out loud. I love this game and still support bluehole, but i need them to get it together.  -------- Let me start by saying this is the best battle royal game i have played and i have played all (this includes every mod based battle royal too.) except h1z1's but that waas due to UI and loot mechanics(i didnt like the inventory).  First ill give the pro points.  PRO: -Large map, it has a lot of areas from thick forest to thinned out forest and lots of cover from rocks to bushes and other random set pieces. Lots of swimmable areas and even a town that is flooded. Military bases and military checkpoints all the way to hunting huts. There are also nice little hidden loot spots too which is nice.  -Loot. As said, every building you can see spawns loot. All of them. There is not one human made structure that doesn't give you loot.  -Weapons. As of now there isn't a massive array of weaponary but what is there is very useful, from pisols, smg to sniper rifles ALL have a high leathality. My highest killing gun is the UMP which is a 9mm varient in this game and it destroys people within 20meters. There is not one gun that doesn't feel like it is useless.  -Buildings. All are very well designed and i feel that the layout inside feels realistic to what a house would have. I mean compared to something like ARMA where you don't know where someone would sleep let alone take a dump this game actually has toilets, pantrys, bedrooms and kitchens. This is useful because it lets you pick better locations in side of the house to have a gunfight in and more objects to hide behind.  -Servers. OCE, Asian, South American, North American and Euro as of now are in the game, which is nice. The latency is great and i have not had one issue yet with my connection to any of the servers i have tried (Asian, NA and OCE) with 180ms to NA servers and 30ms to OCE servers.  -Server load. 100 people in a lobby/match. Short que time with minimal lobby time wait of only 2 minutes tops. If the lobby notices that no one else is joining it will auto start the game after a count down. This means you can have 30 or so people in a lobby then it will start which can at times be annoying but still is nice if you want to play late at night and just have a really intense match with a small amount of people.  -Cars/boat. 3 to choose from at the moment and one boat. All drive very nice compared to Wildlands(the ubisoft game) with minimal issues bar one for me which is that some times it takes a while for the game to notice im trying to enter the car. Not sure if bug or just locational activation issue.  -Weather. It can rain. Not sure if anything else but its nice to have that feature to change up the match. I personally hate it because you can hardly hear anyone around you plus it causes frame issues for me but thats because my computer is pretty garbage.  -Team and solo mode. Okay now this is what worried me about this game. But it was instantly settled once i started playing. Solo means SOLO no teams at all or teaming. I mean people could team up but i have never seen it. Duo is 2 people only, and Squad is up to 4 players, you can enter with 2 or 4 if you want, or you can just go totally solo into squad for an insane challange.  Medical supplies. It takes time to use meds, i know as a BR player healing can be very irritating to deal with in a fight as some can be fast and others non-existant. In this game it takes 3 seconds for Bandage, 6 for pain pills(which is an over time heal) 6 for first aid kits, and 10 seconds or more for Medkit.  CONS:  -LOD issues. I personally get this because i have a normal HDD which is very old and needs to be replaced. But some other people i know have had this issue before. It causes buildings not to load in properly and feels like you are running 1-2fps. You think its your GPU but it isn't its your HDD or RAM being overloaded so it causes the computer to freeze up. A good fix for this is to make sure nothing else is running in the background prior to joining a game. This issue can last as long as your HDD is jammed up or at 100% load.  -Terrain/map issues. Remember with an Alpha or BETA game you will always run into these. Some times if you jump up onto something, it will get you stuck, and there are some locations on the ground or next to walls which will cause this same issue where you are floating. There are also some invisible walls but very few of those.  -Overall Optomization. Pretty much not fully optomized. Expect to change your settings to medium or low/verylow. This can be a pain but later the game will be fully optomized so just take your time.  -Voice chat. Lots of spam so you may aswell turn it off most times.  -Price. Pretty high right now so it can put you off. But if you love Battle Royal games it is so damn worth it i swear on me mum.   Other than that i can't think of any other problems with the game. I am by no means a fanboi of this game i didn't even try get an Alpha version when they offered it. I thought it would be another Culling or a crappy version of H1Z1 but i am happily proven wrong.  I know there are probably more pros/cons i could add but right now none are so glaringly visable that i need to add to this review. The only thing that bothers me the most is just my own hardware not keeping up with this game and that i can fix myself in my own time.  REMEMBER THIS IS A BETA RELEASE REVIEW.

Literally going against a few players that were apparently streamers (Stone valley or something stupid like that), a buddy of mine in my group told me. So I decided to attack them with a car while yelling ""BEEP, BEEP MOTHER F-UCKERS!"" Killing him and his buddy.  Ever since I have been banned for harassment, like wtf? So I spent 30 euros on a game and risk potential ban for a little horse play, its not Like I was constantly going at them or saying racial slurs etc. Really dumb!   Edit: Going to keep the review negative, but I got unbanned! :3 Could be because of my review, and it gaining tension, but still was unjustified and ignorant reason for banning me for a little horse play.  I didn' exploit anything, if honking the car horn and yelling ""Beep Beep Mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" to a streamer gets me banned, that's extremely dumb.  They should definitely start looking into a better system, instead of craddeling streamers balls.  Edit again: Apparently I was banned for stream snipping. I was in a game with a well known streamer ""Rock or Stone valley"" Something on those lines. It was a group game, and I was the only one alive, and my friends were dead, and by chance, 1 of my friends was watching the streamer and realized I was in their game as when I killed someone my name popped up in the recent kills.  So he told me, and me knowing well that I wasn't going to survive much longer with a shotgun and pistol with no health or armour, got into a vehicle and charged straight at them while having my mic turned on ""Intentionally"" while honking and yelling into the mic. "" BEEP BEEP ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" I instantly killed both of them, they were behind a couple of bushes.  I got banned, reason was for harrasment and there was no timer indicating a suspension. Tried contacing the developers, with no response to this day.  To clear things up for whom ever reads this review. I still strongly believe I did not deserve a ban, or any punishment really as it was mere horseplay, and just having fun.",191.3,Not Recommended,9232

We've been playing on Russian region, because that's where we live. He always had latency somewhat near 100ms which isn't so bad if you live in Kazakstan actually.  Just now, after the update (wich implied that the server will be picked automatically baced on your latency, yada yada, we tried to start a game. Well, it just don't start at all.

Sometimes there appears to be a disconnect icon on mine or his nickname (we are still talking about lobby, because we haven't managed to beat it yet).  So after all this we tried to start a solo game by ourselves. Guess what? I've been places on EU server, and he's been placed on Asian server (where he have 250ms ping, yeah).

578080,2017-08-13 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW WAT IS WRONG WITH PUBG?   _INTRO The game concept is fun. As you can see from my hours played, I do enjoy the core game experience of a battle royale with semi-realistic mechanics. However, the developer is working very hard on ruining the experience by creating 3 classes of customers: the ALMIGHTY STREAMER, who allegedly can get players banned by his word alone. The FOOL, who pays real money to unlock crates to get clothing items. And finally, the PLEB PLAYER, who is at the butt of the joke.  Before we get into the 3 classes of customers, what is this about? Well, the developer made 3 relevant statements:    turned out to be a lie as there were microtransactions in EA with the Gamescom crate and all the clothes are on the Steam marketplace now.  is nonsense to me as there are clearly clothing items that are better at camo than others. Visibility is just cosmetic in a game like pubg. See video above.  means that you won't be able to collect a camo-esque outfit after EA for free. You will be forced to pay money for it. You could also find a camo-esque piece of clothing in a match, but it's pretty obvious that someone who starts with a full camo outfit will be at an advantage over someone who has to be lucky and find all the parts in a match.    Now let's look at the ALMIGHTY STREAMER:    Let's look at the FOOL:   Let's look at the PLEB PLAYER:     You will die or find yourself at a disadvantage caused by a bug, bad performance or lag at least once per play session - but if you play this as a lighthearted romp, the derpy state of the game might actually add to the fun. How the dev can perceive his game as ""e-sports ready"" in this state is a mystery though. Same goes for the microtransactions and streamer drama.  That's why I'd recommend the buggy broken game from a few weeks ago before they added paid crates, but cannot recommend the buggy game that wants to be an e-sport with a p2w lottery crate system.",216.7,Not Recommended,4678

Rarely do I write about early access games and the state they are in and VERY rarely do I ever touch a game like this, however 4 friends of mine talked me into testing it out and I`m having a lot of fun.  The game itself is poorly optimized beyond words, major FPS drops even on my GTX 980 TI´s but the gameplay is solid, 90-100 people drop off an airplane have fun and be last man/woman standing.  The pure thrill of being close to one of the last one surviving or playing hide and seek for 20-30 mins is intense and the gunplay is played very very good, playing with teammates everything from duo to 4-6 people just makes the game a hell of a tactical game, planning where to meet what stuff to pickup and how to help each other the best, it is a game that in it´s current state is gonna be very curious to follow and hopefully they will not ♥♥♥♥ it up like a lot of other types of this game.  That being said, the game already paid itself for me due to the drops, I`ve spend 30 bucks on the game and gotten drops for nearly 65 bucks sooo I`m quite okay.  I`m therefor strongly recommending the game as it is now even with the bad FPS drops and connection issues you will find now and then it is diffenetly worth the buy and diffenetly worth keeping an eye on for the future.",1940.1,Recommended,265

578080,2022-01-14 00:00:00,"You´ll read a lot about a ""cheater problem"" here. Are there Cheaters`? Probably Are there as many cheaters as reviews might suggest? No, I´ve not seen more than 10 in all my hours played (EU Servers) and playing with randoms gave me an understanding why everyone believes the game was full of cheaters. ""Yo, got killed from a cheater, I´ll delete this sh*t game"" - Ran into the open and got shot from a guy 200m away while not wearing a helmet or body armor. In at least 95% of the cases people think they met a cheater, something they cannot comprehend happened... the guy was good, even better than them. Killcam? Research on how the Unreal Engine replay works and you´ll understand. Servers are absolutely fine, it´s your connection, leading to 300ms+ pings.  It´s boring because you have to watch you friends play another 15 minutes after you´ve been killed? Go play a game which caters to hot dropping and fast action, PUBG is slower but winning a match is a lot more satifying than in any other game in this genre (at least to me).  Also people leaving bad reviews after more than 1000 hours of playing? Yes, must be really bad! They don´t like the game obviously, otherwise they would´ve put time into it.  Stop complaining about a good game just because people are better than you, your internet is slower than a crippled turtle or you´re playing on a potato.  PUBG is awesome as it is and f2p made it even better.  Edit after some Comments on my profile:  There is the pubg shield project started by the developers. It let´s you review ""Tickets"" and help them identify real cheaters. Participating in that is a measure in helpng pubg to become better. Within in you´ll see cheaters really frequently. This doesn´t indicate that the game is full of those. Don´t forget that putting up the report manually, providing uploaded footage, timestamps and a written explanation, means going out of the comfort zone of just clicking 'report' within a couple of seconds. Blatant cheaters are caught redhanded with this system. It´s like Amazon reviews. If you bought something and it´s nice, do you always leave a review? Probably not. You´re absolutely dissatisfied with you purchase? It´s extremely more probable you´ll go and write how dissatisfied you are.  Edit 2: I´ll turn off the comments here and on my profile again. :steamsalty: You can even stop sending friend requests, they´re going to be declined anyways. The insults below here are just the ones I didn´t report to steam. (apparently not visable after turning comments off. ""Go s*ck d*ck"" "" I *** your mamma"" Just the average Xbox live chat chat banter)  Threats (""I´ll come to your place and slice your throat"" kinda stuff) sent to me via DMs are worse and even though the salty boys who are starving a chicken dinner, because their skill ceiling is below the titanics sea level, are really entertaining to me, it has become just annoying. The passion you people put into hating someone who believes the game is in a good, nowhere perfect, state, is amazing. Take that energy and use it to improve your social skills. You might leave the neckbeard scene and see how being a decent human, something you might turn into, will change your view of how to treat people, even on the internet.  Another addition to the review itself: What we experienced in ranked a couple of times, weren´t cheaters but VPN players. One was even streaming came from china. Popped outta nowhere with a car and all four of my team were dead without even realising what was going on. The review showed they came with a car (we couldn´t hear), shot us (which we couldn´t hear) and left. We weren´t even mad. VPN usage is actually something the Devs have to pay attention to but bringing the core mechanics in a good state was more important and now they might focus on making PUBG a better competitive experience. (This happened like 3 times in 4 weeks of playing ranked all night with my mates.

This game has way too many problems, one of the biggest ones being the endless stream of cheaters ruining any chance of a fair game. Somehow the loot only gets worse and worse with time, turning most games into scavenging sessions that ends in someone shooting you in the head instakilling you after running around looting and chasing the circle for 30 minutes. Vehicles are nowhere to be found either. Not to mention the laughably low tickrate, which doesn't even mange to be constant, making you take hits and die after taking cover, miss shots that should have been hits, struggling to pick things up, just to mention a few things. It's a big shame, really. This game could have been so much fun, but the developers doesn't seem to have any intention of doing anything about any of these problems.",870.4,Not Recommended,187
578080,2019-01-02 00:00:00,"After having put in over 1,000 hours into the game, I can honestly say that sometimes, things just don't change. The game tends to be unstable, no matter what fixes I have attempted, and the idea of having bullets render every time they are shot is honestly the singlemost terrible development model in the history of game development. There's nothing like being shot to death because the game suddenly decides it has to render those bullets, therefore causing a sudden lagspike that ruins any aspect of ""competition"" this game hoped to achieve.  Another point is that the loot distribution system seems completely off-balance. Sometimes you can drop in an area where you'd expect to get high-risk high-reward loot, and come out with level one gear and a shotgun if you're lucky. Meanwhile, Bobby and his friends went to that quiet little outpost in the middle of nowhere and got all the loot he could ever dream of. It feels like the entire loot system needs an overhaul, and the distribution sorting out because there's nothing better than getting nailed by the guy with a fully kitted M24 while you're rocking a Micro-uzi and level 1 armour.  Also, the current bug with diving from the plane where if you press literally ANY KEY on your keyboard, and you get locked into diving straight down, unable to change your course unless you pull you parachute is something that was present on the test server. But did they fix it? No, they did not. They were too focused on getting Vikeni out in time for Christmas so people would want to play their game again and buy their season pass, and gamble their money away on the off chance they get something absolutely amazing from a chest after spending $$$ on keys and getting the same items over and over and over again.  Now, I know that complaining about the loot boxes will most likely elicit responses such as ""Don't buy them then"", and the same goes for the premium season passes. Yes, I could not buy them, and I won't, because honestly, the chances of getting something good from a loot box is abysmal, and you're more likely to get the same cosmetic item and over and over and over again, which leads to frustration, and it feels like it's less ""random"" and more ""you're highly likely to get this item because of the set %"". If it was meant to be totally random RNG, the chances would be somewhat similar. Yes, I understand that rarer items deserve a lower drop rate, but having the same common item drop time and time again leaves much to be desired, and also tends to leave a rather sour taste in the person's mouth as though they'd just sucked on a lemon slice.  As for that, didn't EA get hammered for their microtransactions and loot boxes? Why should any other company get away with borderline gambling in a game that was designed for enjoyment? Nothing is stopping little Jim from grabbing his parent's credit card and blowing a bit of money to try and get absolutely nothing desirable. Gambling, in its purest form is described as such:  ""Gambling is taking part in a game during which you risk money, or something of monetary value, in order to win money or a prize. The outcome of the game is usually down to chance, so when gambling you might leave with less money than you started off with, and sometimes with nothing at all."" - quoted from  So, that money people are spending on keys? They are buying them in the hopes of winning a ""prize"" that they desire, but never end up winning. Are loot boxes not gambling? Because in essence, they are gambling, and ANYONE can participate, as long as they have the money to do so. You cannot write off one company's loot box problem saying ""Oh, it's different"", when another is having lawsuits presented to them over ""unlawful"" actions.  All in all, I cannot recommend this game, not because of the way the company attempts to grab any and all cash they can, but because the game is severely lacking in bug fixes that REALLY need to be addressed, but they are taking their time in doing so, instead introducing new mechanics and new maps as priorities.  I'd give it a 2/10, purely because it managed to drain so many hours of my life away, and left much to be desired.",1046.3,Not Recommended,215
578080,2017-10-26 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Now the hackers and advertisers own it. I and my duo partner we were 500th in NA, from millions. At that level today there is a hacker almost every game. IT IS UNPLAYABLE.  It was a fun game, thrilling and adrenaline pumping. I loved it once despite all the crap devs who are over their heads here shovelled on us.  Crap like laggy servers, people glitching around, you car getting stuck and exploding for no reason, dying AFTER getting into cover, terrible optimization and random frame drops, to mention a fie. AND NOTHING BEING FIXED despite promises.  All that I can live trough but playing just to be shot by some one trough walls and across the map with a headshot.... thats enough. It is not even like counter strike where you can jump in the next game. Here you have spent 20 minutes looting and manoeuvring on the map for a hacker to blow you away effortlessly when he decides to.  The worst is that the B.Hole team is doing nothing about it. Player Unknown, aka Glass Door, made millions from the sales promising to make things better. Then he focused on bringing microransactions in the game, then bringing in game adds we have to look at, even tought everyone of us payed for the game. 2 gigabit ""patch"" to introduce advertisements in game - Intel yey !!! You got to be kidding me!!!  And now Glass Door is focused on getting the game out of Beta so he can cash on his contract with microsoft. microsoft wants the game on console and that's another pile of money for the taking, no matter hackers are running amok and players are begging for help.  The cherry on top is B.Hole banning people for honking near streamers or god forbid if you kill them. Yet in the statistics the top players all with numbers or chinese names have 80 kill/ death ratio but thats no problem! (for comparison some one like shroud who is among the best players has 7.2Kill/death ratio). B.Hole erases those stats but ingame cheaters remain.  DONT BUY THIS GAME untill the hackers have been dealt with and there are no more advertisements ingame plus whatever other pille of manure B.Hole is planning.

578080,2021-01-12 00:00:00,"do not play this game. its full of cheaters and PUBG does not take any responsibility in trying to stop the cheaters. when you do get good at this game people will report you and you will get banned as i do every time i play. their system to stop cheaters have so many flaws. plus when you email PUBG to unban your account, they will reply with the same macro'd answers. i have had too much stress playing this game. i highly recommend not buying this game nor playing.  UPDATE!! As of October 2021, this game has finally died. It is now at its worst state. Now players who've been playing this game for long enough can tell the difference between a good player and a cheater. For me, with almost 4,000 hours, its easy to tell if ones cheating or not. I can easily say that there are more than one team of cheaters in a ranked squad game. For solo ranked, there would be at least 3 players in a game with a cheat. Some would say ""hey theres always been cheaters in this ♥♥♥♥ ass game"" yeah thats true but before when u kill cheaters you would feel pretty good about it and even get that chicken dinner there was nothing to worry about. Now? lol if u kill a cheater squad, you are most likely to get banned. now only you but your entire squad. i know. it sounds stupid. but like i said in my first review. this game bans innocent players like its nothing. i dont know if the cheat has some sort of banning system in it but its getting out of hand. i enjoyed playing solo because there wasnt as many cheaters as squad but now its all the same. **Please, dont torture yourself like i do.

Thanks to Google for translatе my letter (review) :)  Dear PLAYERUNKNOWN, I am writing to you from a distant cold north-western part of the Russian Federation, or, more simply, from the Republic of Karelia. My name is Andrey, I'm 22 years old. I became one of your big fans after playing in your modification to the game ArmA 3, I mean BattleRoyal (I apologize if I wrote the name of the mod slightly wrong, there like all the capital letters, but I unfortunately do not remember, played a very long time). Then I believed, and still believe that this is a breakthrough in the gaming industry, a regime where hundreds of players are released to the open terrain, where they have to kill each other with what they find in this locality. And this mode is called Battle Royal, it's cool, isn't? Thanks to you, I decided to learn more about the setting of the Battle of the King: I watched two parts of the film of the same name, and all sorts of trash American films, like ""The Condemned"" and ""The Hunger Games"", read a couple of books where deytvie occurs in a similar genre, in general, was not boring. I learned a lot of things about survival in different conditions. Maybe someday it will come in handy, but I hope not. Thanks for this. And now, perhaps, I will go to the root of the problem, because of what I'm just writing this review. Rather, when you were an ordinary mod designer, I would not write about it. But now you have a serious company, and on the sales of this wonderful game you earned, I'm sure a lot of money. So, buy more servers, and if possible, put them in Russia. I put the search game, waited 10 minutes, got angry, went to the grocery store for an hour, came back, and, wait for it, the game is still being looked for! How i must understand this?! I spent 1/20 of my salary on your game, but I can not play it, because you see, it's not looking for a game. And yet it is badly optimized: in main menu at the low graphics settings I have a slide show. Correct, please. I hope you will see this appeal to you, or I will have to return my money, sorry.

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

578080,2018-02-22 00:00:00,"So after nearly 200 hours of gameplay, and a multitude of ups and downs in this game. I finally decided to collect my thoughts and share them here.  PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (Henceforth known as Pubg) is a battle royale shooter, similar to ArmA 2/3 BR and H1Z1. The concept is simple, 100 players drop out of a plane over an island or a Trump-Wallesque desert, scrounge up the best gear they can find, and kill each other. Last man/woman standing wins, but you don't really need to hear that, the game has been out for nearly a year, and if you haven't heard of Pubg by now, then I don't even know anymore.  Pubg does a lot of things right. The gunplay, when it works correctly, is phenomenal. It feels tight and responsive, the bullet physics feel accurate, and especially rewarding when landing long range shots. This is arguably it's strongest suit. The original map that the game launched with 'Erangel' is a great mix of different terrains and hotspots allowing different routes to be taken in order to achieve victory, and is easily the stronger map of the two. The movement, for the most part is good. However I will touch on this a little later.  Despite the multitude of things that Pubg gets right, it gets so much wrong. Hackers are a major problem in this game, even after the implementation of PUBG Corp's proprietary Anti-Cheat. Wallhackers, Aimbotters, Norecoil. Hackers are rampant in this game. Ping abuse is another problem. There is a reason you see people spamming #RegionLockChina, and it's not an attempt at racist humour. Not in the slightest. People from countries such as China, tend to join NA and EU servers in order to abuse the fact thaat the desync in this game causes them to be able to demolish people without any issue due to the fact that they are next to impossible to shoot, due to their high ping. Desync itself is still a major issue, with major rubberbanding, hit registration and a plethora of other issues still plaguing this game. A recent example of this would be when I unloaded 20 bullets from a Scar-L, point blank into an enemies chest, only for them to soak it up, turn around and drop me in two shots. The death cam registered three bullets hitting him. THREE. There was more than three blood sprays shooting from his body, so my client registered that bullets had hit, but the server did not. I was on an EU server, with 40 ping. This again ties in to my earlier point regarding movement. While the movement is pretty solid, the fact that the desync, coupled with the games rubberbanding issues are still present. Movement is more often than not a challenge. When your game struggles to handle something as basic as movement fluidly. We got a problem.  These issues, while major, could be overlooked to a certain extent if the game remained in early access. This is where one of my main gripes remains. This is sold to the end user as a finished product. A game rampant with hackers, lag issues, server desync, and basic hit registration issues, is not only being sold as a full game, but is also touted as 'eSports ready'. A game in which the chances of you actually hitting someone seem all but randomized, is considered 'eSports ready'.  However, none of my complaints matter at the end of the day. I bought the game, PUBG Corp/Bluehole made their money, and that's all that counts at the end of the day.  Do I recommend this game? Sure, I guess I do, winning in this game is a sheer adrenaline rush. It's unlike any other game I've ever played.  Do I think you should buy this game? No. Not until this is a stable product, that has a handle on the hackers, has fixed the issues with servers, and has restricted access from players from a high ping locale.  TL:DR This game is good, but it's also trash. Play Fortnite instead, that actually works.  EDIT: To those thinking that my comment about playing Fortnite was real, it wasn't. I was being facetious, if anything it's worse than pubg, considerably so. I was just making a joke about how bad PUBG can be. Chill with the salt boys.",344.7,Not Recommended,612

578080,2020-11-21 00:00:00,"Introduction  PUBG always looked janky as hell to me but I still bought it a year ago since I had nothing else to play. I payed 15 Euros for it back then and with my 58 hours of game time I guess I got my money’s worth. But actually I am really wondering if I even had a single hour of fun with this game.   The good things  - The weapons sound and feel real - [EDIT: Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly since this game is an offspring of Arma 2) the bullets come out of the barrel and NOT your eyes. This is very seldom even to this day and highly appreciated! - The sound of the suppressed weapons is top notch (yes, I am a gun geek) - The level design although at times quite odd is very, very good. Especially since some of the maps are HUGE and filling them with interesting stuff is hard. Then again, maybe one shouldn’t speak of level design and more about decorating the levels. To be honest, I don’t know if there is actual design in there.     - As good as the weapons feel, I just keep missing. Either I am really bad at this particular game because of an highly realistic gunplay (bullet comes out of the barrel not out of the scope, there is bullet drop, each weapon/caliber has its own bullet velocity), OR this game does have serious issues with hit detection. To be fair, I think the former is true. - The game doesn’t look too good at times. - Animations are hit or miss. - Performance is hit or miss, too. Now it is quite good but it was very bad a few updates ago. - At times you are looting for 20 minutes just to get shot without ever having fired a single bullet.     - I am probably Lvl 32 by now and I am CONSTANTLY getting matched with lvl. 500 players (or with lvl. 376 players). - You can’t choose a map anymore. So you are either playing a BIG, slow-paced map or a small, fast-paced map, and it doesn’t matter what you wish for. - The game is VERY time consuming. This is especially true since the TTK is very low in this game. Normally I am all for it but in a battle royale mode it is just eating up more of your time since you will die, matchmake, do nothing for 60 seconds, jump off the plane, land, loot, run to another location, loot, run to another location, loot (+ 50 times more), get shot by a lvl. 500 player, repeat.     This game is a waste of money and, what’s much worse, a waste of time. Only buy this one if Cuisine Royale is not enough for you, Warzone is too simple and Apex Legends is too good for you. I don’t know why I keep coming back to this game. Probably because I forget what makes it so bad. Indeed it is very hard to put a finger on makes it such a bad game. I sure hope I can finally close this chapter once and for all and never look back. Wish me luck.",63.0,Not Recommended,324

578080,2017-10-19 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Played for months with the rare siting of a hacker. Now that an article was published, clearly boasting how amazing the Anti-Cheat system is for PUBG, the OCE servers are now flooded with hackers. These range from speed hacks, to aimbots, and rapid fire bolt action rifles. ""banning 6k players a day my ass""  Even though I like the game, I need to negative rep it for all the baseless boasting I've seen over the recent few weeks about Anti-cheat, how ""original"" the concept of the game is compared to the other battle royal counter parts, and some other minor issues.",969.3,Not Recommended,832
578080,2018-01-13 00:00:00,"I never ever write reviews for games. In fact, this is the first review I have posted on steam. I'm writting this at 1:15 am for some reason but whatever. I just want to give my opinion on the game as of 1-13-2018. I was very suprised to see that this game has such mixed reviews. Anyway, enough about me; let's get on with the review!  Pros: (Stuff I like about it) Fun to play with friends Great for strategy lovers (Feels like you are really in the hunger games) Getting a kill is very exiting Great graphics Very realistic gameplay Loading time between each game is very short Veriety of ways to play If you die in this game, it's like ""eh, no biggy, on to the next game!"" (Doesn't make me mad easily) There are a few more I can't think of right now.  Something to understand: Alot of waiting. (Depends on playstyle) If you are not a god at fps games, you will probably end up waiting alot and hiding. Most people want to go to areas with lots of people and just play like it's Call of Duty Deathmatch or something. Unless you are like in the top 1% of ffps players, you will die going into big cities and trying to kill everyone. I bought this game expected more shooting and killing, but going guns blazing into a crowded city is not how you win this game. That's not a bad thing as it turns out. I have had loads of fun playing this game, but in a strategic sense. I found that most of the fun I would get out of the game came once you get to be one of the last 10-15 people alive. That's when it gets really intense. My heart starts pounding and my hands start shaking. But up until that point, you mostly are going to be just going through houses and looting for better gear.  TLDR; Beginning of game is a little boring, middle of the game is ok/good(30-20 people left), end of the game(~10 people left) is amazing and where pubg shines.  Cons:(Stuff I don't like) Rng can screw you over. Where the circles are is RNG. What weapons you find is RNG. The vehicle spawns are random (mostly) Sometimes you will just get screwed by RNG and can't do anything about it. Vehicle phisics are still kinda broken (Look up pubg fails on youtube, half of the ""fails"" will be vehicle glitches Players can be toxic (squads) Some game mechanics are not explained when you first start playing. e.g pressing b will change firing modes, ctrl 1,2,3,4 changes vehicle seats, right clicking invintory will make it change slots instantly.  It's getting late so I'm going to wrap this up:  Overall I have really enjoyed this game. I would recommend it to people who enjoy strategy and tactical thinking. It's a great game to play with friends and have a good time. If you like realism in games, this game is for you. The amount of control you have over your character is amazing. If you like the hunger games or ever wanted to feel like you were in it, definetly check this game out. I think that for its price (about half of AAA games like Call of Duty) this game is worth if you like strategy and some fps mixed in. I would give this game a 8/10. Would buy again.  Anyway sorry for any mistakes in this review, I have no prior experience writing reviews so this one might be a little, uh, ""meh"" Hope this helped and if you ever want someone to play with, hit me up :D Ok good night and good luck in Player Unkown's Battlegrounds!",57.3,Recommended,256

578080,2017-03-23 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Note: I did get this game for free. I got it for free because I took part in the Pre-Alpha that happened (I think) in July of 2016. Getting the game for free doesn’t affect my review at all (it gets nit and gritty towards the end).  ---  For those wondering, why is this so familiar?  - Well, because the person behind this game is PLAYERUNKNOWN (as stated in the title of the game). It’s his standalone game. He first started his Battle Royale work in Arma 2/3 as Mods. Than Daybreak licensed Battle Royale gamemode from him and they implemented that his game mode in their game called ‘H1Z1,’ later on they saw the potential of Battle Royale and they split the game into 2 games with one game that only has the Battle Royale game mode called H1Z1.  What does BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) feel like?  - It’s a mixture of Arma 3 and H1Z1, but more or less it feels like Arma (but not clunky) since it’s not arcadey like H1Z1 and it actually takes skill to learn. It’s not just about getting kills. It’s about surviving. If you like tactical’ness, outsmarting your opponent, a non-clucky engine like Arma 3 and just an overall fun time. This is the game for you. In Arma 3, it’s slow pace and walking everywhere, sometimes taking a vehicle. In H1Z1, almost everyone is in a car and if you get near someone they jump out (while the car is going full speed) and they try to shoot you. In this game, it’s medium pace, the vehicles in BATTLEGROUNDS will get you killed if you randomly jump out to kill someone at full or half speed.  In BATTLEGROUNDS, you have servers where you can go Solo or find a teammate(s) in Duo and SQUAD, just like in H1Z1. Unlike in H1Z1, but like in Arma 3, if you team in Solo servers you will get banned. PLAYERUNKNOWN promised that Mod support would be coming at official release. But, Mod support is nowhere to be found in 1.0. They stated that Mod support to the point where you can create your own Battle Royale game mode (and publish it to the Steam Workshop), host it (maybe rent a server like in the Battlefield series) and have your own community or group of friends play it. Weapon-wise, all these weapons don’t have predicable weapon recoil, they’re all different, as well with the bullet drop/travel. Attachments like forgrips, compensators and more all can decrease the recoil and change the final outcome of the game when it comes down to that 1v1 at the end. You can’t use 3rd person shooting all the time, it’s not accurate as 1st person shooting (like in H1Z1, both 1st and 2nd can be used at medium/long).  As I mentioned in the beginning, getting the game for free doesn’t affect my review at all. But because this is a review, I have to be unbiased and review all aspects of the game, even the company behind the game. I give the score what I gave it because of one issue. They were very disrespectful, closed minded and banned me on many platforms to censor me. I would have given this game a 9/10 if this situation didn’t happen/taken place.  In the end, I’m glad PU made the Mod in Arma 2/3 and Daybreak licensed the Battle Royale mode from PLAYERUNKNOWN. He got rid of the clucky’ness from Arma and understood all of H1Z1 mistakes, downfalls, lack of communication/game updates and made his own game. And to be honest with you, this game is pretty bada** and worth the buy. I’m glad that I was able to see this game grow when when Pre-Alpha was going on. And let's face it, H1Z1 is still in Early Access just this upcoming January in 2018, it will be 3 years in Early Access... PUBG put H1Z1 in it's coffin.  It’s one of those games that you will come back and play each day just because how fun it is, H1Z1 (or other BR related titles) can’t do this.  ---  My Review Score: 8/10",316.7,Recommended,643

People liked the more tactical methodical game play, but they made fast hyper aggro combat maps. People liked to be able to choose maps, but they took that option away so people would play the less popular maps. Bots became rampant, wouldn't do anything about it. Removed specific queues to funnel people into more populated queues. All while gameplay and mechanical issues were not being fixed they kept pumping out seasonal and purchasable items.

It has opportunities for close in firefights as well as sniping. There are still issues with aimbots and autohotkey scripts to eliminate recoil and matchmaking is still catastrophicly bad. But I am having fun on the new map. Hopefully the game will continue to improve.

578080,2018-02-27 00:00:00,"Totally unbiased Review of PUBG  This is my second review on this game earlier I had given it a negetive rating because I was frustrated by the cheaters in almost every match.But that was more of a rant than a review. Now before I begin (don't worry I will keep things short and precise) please note this is more of an informative review rather than a negetive review.  Like many others I got this game when it was in early access. I used to play it a lot with my friends and had some fun too. I even used to play it a lot in single player mode too when I was new and even then I liked it. But after spending 350+hours I started to get bored.If you are a person who likes to try out almost every type of game then you may enjoy it too for the first 100-200hrs with that you will also get your money's worth. Now if you are looking for a fair competitive game then I would say look somewhere else as this game may not be for you. Mainly because its unfair and unbalanced.  In PUBG you spend 10 minutes in looting then another 10-15 mins either camping or running from the blue circle. If you are unlucky then you will get killed soon after you have finished looting by someone from a location which you may not spot easily. Otherwise jump to a crowded location and start testing your luck. If you take the first approach then for most of the time you ae literally doing nothing in the game except wasting time. In the second scenario you may not even get a gun by looting a 2 storey house but your opponent will get it within few seconds inside a small house and will kill you with it. In both scenario's you will either get frustrated and angry or satisfied momentarily (if you managed to kill someone).The game only becomes intense during the last 5 mins. Loots are generally medical supplies to boost your health and gun attachments to increase the shot's accuracy.  These things may be fun for some people but not for me. But these are not the only reasons I left playing this game the main reasons are these : 1. BUGS. There are a lot of bugs in this game. Lot means a lot.Everyday people are discovering something new. You can headover to reddit to know more about them. Due to these you may loose an easy win situation. I think many people including me have experienced this many times. 2.Server desync & bad ping are the biggest nonsense in this game.eg: I hit a guy many times but he didn't go down instead he kills me easily with max 2 shots? When I check the replay it shows that I only hit him once or twice. 3.Cheaters. Now they are very less compared to last few months. However you may come across 1 or 2 in a day compared to 1 in almost every match previously.(I have upoaded some videos exposing some cheaters you can view them from my profile)  However bluehole has not solved some of the old bug issues yet (the parachute opening, item visibility while landing etc). Instead they are focussing on something else. Battleroyale genre is like a fad and nothing else.Every one is jumping in it to make some quick profits till it lasts. From battle royale genre I have only played PUBG & H1Z1 & I liked the later more. The current state of H1Z1 however is not good & I think PUBG will soon follow its path too. I think the devs are aware of this too thats why they are trying to grab as much as they could during this time.  Anyways I have nothing against them personally its their decision to make money in whichever way they see fit.Currently I have not much interest in this game.

578080,2017-10-26 00:00:00,"Can't Recommend this game right now. Hackers are infesting the servers and Bluehole is doing nothing about it. They claim to be banning a ton of accounts, but every leaderboard is still filled with hackers. If you enjoy being killed by someone you can't see or hear, buy this game.  Edit: I have been running into less and less hackers, which is nice. The client side hit detection, server lag, and lack of executable timeline still bothers me and makes me not want to recommend the game. However, it is alot of fun.  Edit 2: Great new release. The gameplay is fun, smooth, different and enjoyable. Feels almost like a brand new game. Thank god they added the deathcam so I can now at least feel validated when I am killed by a hacker. Still hacks on hacks, cannot recommend until they region lock.  Edit 3: Still winning games. The new map is so fun, I am having a blast. Yet... Still. STILL. Running into a hacker at least every 2 games. Bluehole won't region lock because China is big money. Sooooooooooo with no solution in sight, why recommend this game? Hardly matters with how many chinese accounts there are...  Edit 4: I now exclusively play First Person because of the hacking issue. This has been a decent temporary fix. However, still no region lock, still no server side hit detection, and still high ping desync issues. They have now made hundreds of millions of dollars but no long term solution in sight.  Edit 5: Never have I played a game that has received this much money, support, and recognition from its player base. Never have I played a game that continually had issues with hackers, server stability and desync killings.  Edit 6: This is what I now think of this game almost 1 year later.  First off, YOU LITERALLY ARE DOING NOTHING WITH A 5 HOUR UPDATE.  Second, I love the road map to a bug free experience. Did you decide to drop that just like you dropped the source code for Tencent to make and sell hacks on the side? Did you drop the road map like the pro players who were dropped from the game in YOUR BIGGEST LIVE COMPETITION OF THE YEAR? Or perhaps did you drop the road map like how every executive decision seems to come from someone who was DROPPED ON THEIR HEAD AS A BABY.  This is the best competitive team based FPS I have ever played, and Bluehole could literally care less about their player-base. You are sh*tting all over your playerbase who would leave IN A HEARTBEAT for the same game with simply improvements.  5 HOUR UPDATE TO ADD WEAPON SKINS BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T MADE ENOUGH MONEY YET?  This company, this experience, is going down in the history books as a prime example of what happens when a company takes a billion dollar idea, and strips it down for millions of dollars instead. I hope that my children will read about the absolutely sh*tshow that is Bluehole, the absolute lack of care towards their product, and the fiery destructive downfall when ANYBODY releases a similar game. I'm talking about a realistic battle-royal FPS for anyone telling me to play fortnite or COD.  Honestly, I once sh*t myself in public in front of my crush, and that level of public humiliation is a drop in the bucket compared to the FARCE that is the state of this game. Not only have you been sh* tting all over the code, all over the playerbase, all over our wallets, Bluehole has also been sh*tting in the mouths of every single loyal player.  760,000 reviews and you haven't taken a hint. 13000 mostly negative reviews in the past month, and you push out a SKIN DLC 5 HOUR UPDATE.  At this point, I cannot even liken you to taking a dump all over this loyal playerbase. It is more like Bluehole is a drug-pusher, PUBG is the product, AND YOU KEEP CUTTING IT WITH CRAP. KEYS, CRATES, PURCHASABLE COSMETIC ITEMS. Be honest, did EA come over and train your whole executive team on how to bend the playerbase over and absolutely PLOW us through our wallets? I can only surmise the pure evil that this company embodies has come from an outside source.  I pray that every executive at Bluehole is put in a plane that crash lands on a deserted Island where you are forced to fight over resources ""Hunger Games"" style.  You have become the embodiment of all that is wrong with politics. The deceit, the lack of solutions, the corruption, the CEO making 13 million dollars from a drug that is pushed onto teenagers and internet cafes. You have transcended Hitler and Nazi Germany, Stalin and communist Russia, and Trump as the most despicable pieces of sh*t ever.",1595.3,Not Recommended,834

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.  Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.  Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.  Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.  Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

578080,2019-03-24 00:00:00,"A Retrospective Review  So, I'm over a thousand hours in and I'm stepping away from PUBG for a hiatus. I'm not sure I'll ever be back.  While playing this game I've experienced wonder and elation from the emergent moments. Getting kills or winning games in this pioneer of the Battle Royale genre are unlike anything else in gaming. You can ride the high of a single win for days. I have routinely played with a squad where winning two or three games in a row isn't uncommon. You feel like a god among mortals.  But for every one of those highs there were between 10 and 50 moments of frustration, incredulity, and rage.  This game constantly violates a personally held intense desire for . And yes, it's on me to regulate my emotional response to a video game. But this game's RNG (circle position and loot distribution) can so directly dictate your percentage-chance of winning a game, it has the same psychological and physiological effects as a losing streak when gambling.  You sit down at the table and place your bet. You've already lost a dozen hands in a row, so your brain tricks you into thinking you're ""due"" for a win. You're dealt two 10s. You split. You're dealt a 9 and a king. Your sympathetic nervous system is in overdrive. You're certain now to win, so your dopamine receptors are primed for a hit. Adrenaline is being fed into your body. Then the dealer flips over their blackjack.  You've been playing PUBG all evening, but you've mostly been playing walking simulator or getting killed early without a gun in your hands. You queue for game, and you drop into North Georgopol with your buddies. No one else is there. You walk out of your first building with your ideal kit, 2/2/2, two first aids and some boosts. And then you see the circle has centered on Novo.  When you don't win, there's a negative fallout because you don't get the dopamine hit you were expecting, so you feel bad - you get that sinking feeling in your stomach, your blood pressure drops precipitously from the high it was at just a moment ago.  The problem is when I feel the loss was unfair, whether because of RNG or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ netcode/desync, there's a compounding effect. I start to feel the game is working actively against me and in favor of other players. I know this is illogical and is actually not the case. However, when I walk out of the two high tier loot buildings outside of Power Grid on Miramar with a shotgun, a Win94, and no armor and then the redzone centers on me, it's hard not to feel like RN-Jesus doesn't have a vendetta. Or when the bullet that downs me registers when on my screen I'm in a bathroom with no windows and no line of sight to the enemy.  Feel free to tell me to git gud. I know I'm not great at this game. I'm in my thirties, and the last shooter I played seriously was CoD4:MW ten years ago. I'm not carrying anyone to victory, despite occasional flashes of brilliance.  Regardless, the game's persistent issues, and Bluehole's unwillingness or inability to fix them have left me unable to continue playing it. And what's sad is there will likely never be another game like it, since every BR game released since has lacked the military realism and emphasis on strategy and smart positioning that make PUBG so compelling to me.  Ultimately, perhaps if you're better at controlling your emotions than I am, you will continue to relish the victories when the circle falls in your favor, and you get the drop on that last squad or duo. For now, it's just time for me to take a break.",1395.6,Recommended,65

578080,2018-11-20 00:00:00,"PUBG Corp initiated their ""Fix PUBG"" development sprint in early August and ended it with great fanfare in mid November. By mid September, the game was no longer competitively playable for me due to problems with UI transition frame latency. I would love to help debug this, but PUBG support's job description appears to be ""annoy anyone who would try to report bugs with insane claims and demands until they go away"". Support are absolutely fantastic at their jobs.  Additionally, the game will kick me for using any of the following:  * GPU power management software * Twitch chat software * A web browser * VOIP software * Stream management software * Clock software * Any form of authentication agent * Any music software * Any video software * Any other game (such as while waiting fifteen minutes for a lobby)  The end result is that this game is essentially unstreamable for me.

On a bunch of occassions I would be hiding motionless in tall grass or a super dark shaddow and someone 100m+ away would spot me and pick me off really quickly. It made me scratch my head since on my screen I was virtually invisible. I tried turning my settings down and then I realized on low settings the darkness contrast between shaddow and direct sunlight is near zero - about 90-95% of the foliage and grass disappears - character models are super distinct against in game objects - low render distance means that character models still render at max distance, but all of their visual cover disappears (you can literally look through trees, bushes, and grass. It's like having a wall hack turned on).  In summation - it's a really cool game, but I am not interested in playing with potato quality graphics.

PROS  - [GAME PLAY] I love the weight of the equipment, cars, movement and just the over all feel of the game is something that always draws me to it over other titles. Getting an elimination in PUBG feels infinetly more rewarding compared to other shooting titles I've played. I think its due to the fact its not really the easiest mechanically to control the character/gun and the strategy alone required in a big open map to successfully elim other teams makes the payoff feel huge.  - [SOCIAL] The Friends who are able to tolerate sucking at the beginning of playing this game I can guarantee you will be some of the best friends you can ever make because if they can Enjoy PUBG without having to win every game they are typically very down to earth people who enjoy the process of things more than the flashy winning titles and made up accolades (besides Steam Acheivements those are very important)  - [COSMETICS] As someone who loved H1Z1's customization and would spend hours manipulating the market to afford 30 cent items I can easily say PUBG is just as good. If you don't want to be a Kpop star thats fine I guess.. you can be literally customize to whatever you want to wear whether thats Apocalytpic/steam punk gear, designer fashion wear, Jeremy Lin for some reason, or you can be a giant polar bear. All cosmetics are pretty cheap or easily earned through Contraband boxes. All my skins are from twitch drops and contraband and my inventory is lookin nice.   CONS  - [BOTS] There are AI players that fill up lobby's to make sure you don't ride on empty planes. They arn't too annoying at first until you have had to figure out the shooting you have heard for 5 mins is two bots battling to the death missing every shot. They dont feel too rewarding to elim and dont actually carry useful loot other than the bullets you used to take them out.  - [DARK SIDE OF SOCIAL] A lot of the time people who play this game are closeted Mil Sim enjoyers who think they are legit on deployment siege-ing the fields of a foreign country sitting on top of Oil reserves. Literally if you take away anything from this post Don't pay these people any attention they are very controlling in their game plan. Best advice is when they get knocked out you can see their true nature come out as they screamed to be revived as if they legit got shot.  - [LEARNING CURVE] This isn't really a con but be prepared to deploy the parachute and land late, loot all game and see no one then get shot in the back for many many games... As someone who loves games like Firewatch just pretend that its going to be a lot of exploration for sometime. You wont know where to look or where to be but over time things come naturally just always make sure above all else to have fun when trying to learn.

578080,2018-06-30 00:00:00,"PUBG started off as an enjoyable, yet glitchy, experience. Novel in its approach, PUBG allowed people to enjoy the game in a few different ways until the matches reached their apex of tension with the ever shrinking circle of death. In the end, only one person could survive, being crowned with the phrase ""WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!"". But, for all of the novelty of this game the actual fun of the game quickly decreased only to be replaced with the frustration of a buggy system, a increasing amount of cheaters, and a cash grab for cosmetics. Having reached over 50 million sales, it is quite amazing that BlueHole would have felt the necessity to institute a pay for cosmetics out of loot crates that you earn from playing the game. What is the point of playing, when only one person can win a game, if the rewards can only be unlocked with real cash? It's certainly not because the game play is top notch.  I would have recommended this game, earlier, had they not instituted a pay-to-unlock-rewards policy. Instead of working on a flawed reward system it makes sense that they would have focused on working out the bugs and decreasing cheaters so that the game remains an enjoyable experience. For all of their statements about working out their kinks and combatting a slew of cheating programs, they've accomplished very little actual progress in regards to those goals. Every patch seems to introduce a new level of bugs while hindering performance in some way. These performance drops being explained away as anti-cheat software negatively impacting performance actually show no signs of slowing down the cheaters. In the games before I stopped playing, I had so few matches end because I lost fairly and not because a cheater was shooting out of a car which was halfway across the map and getting headshots even though the player wasn't even aiming.  PUBG has one good thing going for it, if not depressing in hindsight, that developers can publish an unpolished game and then reap the benifits of a flawed system that they have no intention of correcting because for every ban they hand out they then receive one more sale.

578080,2017-08-11 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Through Fire And 10 Year Olds  Survive , something we do every day of our lives. The very essence of our existance, although complex, is key to why we're here, playing video games. PUBG takes that idea and amplifies it to an entire new level. It all begins on an island with what seems like thousands of kids screeching 'China Numba 1'. Then you're in a plane with these disembodied voices cutting in and out because the apple ear buds are just not quite good enough to understand. The entire world opens up upon you as your mind rambles through the array of options you have to jump. Military base looks safe and you hit 'F' with only chicken for dinner on your mind. As you soar through the sky, you notice the 25 parachutes below, open up. Going 224 km/h in an attempt to catch up and land might just be enough. Then the daunting moment of realization hits you like a brick, only 20 feet from the ground your speed is now 1km/h and a guy appears in your peripheral. Somehow he managed to obtain a crossbow and aims at your head. Before your feet touch the ground, the last thing you hear is the arrow whizzing through the sky.     In order to understand why this game is good and why you should buy it, you will need to know some background information as to how this game rose to the colossal fame it has today. Let's start off with the creator, Playerunknown, he did not just make PUBG as some would believe. He is also known for a variety of other games such as modding for and which are both very popular and high selling games. After coming out with H1Z1, his next goal was to perfect the Royale archetype. This led to our lovely game called PUBG. Once this game was released, it was picked up very rapidlyby streamers such as etc... This led to the uprise and popularity of the game very quickly with little effort and little marketing from the devs. Now let's get into the actual game mechanics and how it works.  (TL:DR at Bottem)   Yes, this is an Early Access game which many people tend to forget. Do not expect that level of polish. There is still work to be done. Understand the game needs to be developed and fleshed out. New maps, vehicles, weapons are on their way. There are, without a doubt, some connection issues, bugs, and areas that require optimization. This all comes with the Early Access aspect of the game and, hopefully, by the time the game is released, all will be resolved. Try and give the developers a beak when your car gets stuck in a railing and explodes. Remember, it's Early Access. Besides, it's hilarious when that happens to one of your friends.   Many of the more negative reviews are complaining about the optimizaiton and their ability to not run this game at 60 fps on ultra. PUBG does not require a GOD PC to play on, but does not run well on a potato. If your computer does not meet the minimum requirements, don't buy the game. Now let us say that little Tommy does meet the requirements and has a bit better than the minimuim. That Does Not mean you can run this game on ultra nor should you want to. Running this game on lower settings is actually a strategic advantage. Less detail in-game = more visibality to see the enemies. A lot of the popular streamers, even with GOD PCs, run this game on low for this advantage. As time passes and they keep optimizing, more people will be able to play it on their weaker PCs. For now, try to have the minimum requirements:  OS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Processor: Intel Core i3-4340 / AMD FX-6300 Memory: 6 GB RAM Graphics: nVidia GeForce GTX 660 2GB / AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB DirectX: Version 11 Network: Broadband Internet connection Storage: 30 GB available space    Controling your weapon in this game is not as easy as one might think. Each gun has its somewhat of a spray and can be sort of learned which is an aspect that might turn some players away. Not every gun has a SET pattern like in CS:GO. The shots are sometimes random and makes it difficult to predict at times.    Now let's get into a very important point of the game, dying. Dying is part of any PvP game and frustrates many after spending a long time looting to just get killed by some kid in a bush. The truth is, YOU WILL DIE MANY TIMES, no matter how good you are or how good your loot is, it is inevitable that you will die more than you succeed. As you die more and more, slowly, you will become smarter and better at the game. The great thing about death in this game, is you can reque right after and keep on playing away! So don't worry if you die a lot when you start off, it happens to the best of us.   We're finally at my FAVORITE topic about this game. Quick background about skins, they are unboxed through in-game crates using BP which is earned by playing. They're clothes for your character and are worth money on the Steam Market. In the recent update they added 3 new crates of which 2 are free. The other one which is the invitational crate, costs 2.5$ to open which made many people angry. The negative reviews are mainly complaining about how they should focus on fixing the game and not skins. What they fail to realize is that a good portion of the money collected from the crate sales is going to pay for the PUBG invintational event, prize pool, and charity. The devs are SOOO money hungry right? Giving to charity, pshhh, what greedy devs they are.  TL:DR",656.6,Recommended,71
578080,2021-03-10 00:00:00,"Coming back to this game years after I last played it was depressing. I remember Bluehole's promises of polish and content; dropping into Miramar and Erangel for the first time since 2018 made me glad that I didn't stick around to see them realized, because they never were. The game still runs poorly, cheaters are still a major issue, and Bluehole's solution to the bleeding playerbase was to add barely-functional bots. It took me 10 minutes to queue for a standard match, because the game is dead outside of East Asia.  It feels surreal that I can call PUBG dead. I used to laugh at the people who said PUBG was dying back when it was the most popular game on Steam three times over. Now, with its remaining population sequestered away from western players via region lock, don't ever expect to see a quick queue or a botless game ever again.

578080,2017-03-23 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A dedicated Battle Royale game where you have to win out of about 100 people who usually enter a server. The circle shrinks and you have to enter the circle and be the last man/woman standing to win. All the stats are recorded and you can view them in game. There are solo mode, duos and squad so you can team up if you want. I havent seen any cheating, such as going through walls etc and there doesnt seem to be many bugs.  This game uses the unreal engine 4, graphics for early access are pretty good, in some of the larger towns it struggles alittle on my machine but its early access so plenty of time to fine tune the fps. The sounds are good, works well with my surround headphones so I can tell where shots are coming from.  The developer is well known and I'm confident player unknown and his team will make this game even better than it is already. My personal opinion is that its more sim than h1z1 but slightly less but not far off from arma3 BR, games seem to be slightly quicker than arma3 br.

578080,2020-01-28 00:00:00,"Sit down, take a seat by the fire, stay a while and listen to an old mans yarn...  Once upon a time, there was a majestic game called PUBG. It was on track to be the best game on PC, it had it all. The game was fun alone, fun with friends, and then, without warning...  The 1st Death: ...a wave of hackers arrived, unfathomably large, every game was essentially ruined. There was flying cars, wall hacks, aim lock, speed hacks, and all the stuff that any good anti-cheat will detect, but PUBG stood idly by and did nothing, and it has yet gone largely unchallenged. If you believe what they say, then why is the game still swarmed with aim-lock and walls? The game was, and still is, riddled. It was present, but not unplayably-present in the early days, but it was the dawn of the unlocked regions and the invasion of US and EU, by Chinese hackers, that killed the game the first time round. [Like Sekiro, it died twice.] (Note: People will dispute this, about the Chinese hackers, but the evidence[segmentnext.com] shows the culture of gaming there breeds a lack of care for the good of the game and, lack of care for good sportsmanship. It's a fact. Check the links for reference.)  The 2nd Death: The game, somehow, got worse as time went on. It's like all ArmA-mods-gone-full-game's are born into some gaming version of Benjamin Button, where you start off great and regress into an unplayable mess of sadness, with unachievable promises and poor decision making. PUBG and Day Z are the prime examples. The game tried to fly before it could sprint before it could walk before it could breath before it was even born... if that long drawn out nothing even makes sense... Games broken? New guns :)! No micro's in early access? Brendan >:) eSports leagues when the game runs so poorly, that most have to play it on PS1 settings? Sick all done! How's about turning off grass and terrain details to see where people are? Yeaaaah boi!  You get the picture. If you want to waste money, I'd recommend doing so in literally any other way possible. Roll up the notes and smoke them. Flush the money. Buy a really nice ice cream and yeet it really far. I don't know, but what I do know is I, and so many others, give and gave the game a chance every now and then, until YuBeTV513526235 blows my head off through a wall with full auto, and the game then crashes and literal ♥♥♥♥ sprays out of every possible hole on my PC, into my mouth.

578080,2023-01-08 00:00:00,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1214.5,Recommended,270

578080,2018-12-07 00:00:00,"this game, frankly, is an absolute disaster from start to finish.  To begin with, the core gameplay itself is still dominated by so many bugs, exploits and cheaters that it's difficult to actually tell if someone is cheating or if the game is just itself broken. Killcam weapons will snap to targets and be mysteriously absent of recoil. Players will know where you are through walls and floors. That kind of thing. The odds of fighting more than 2 or 3 groups before encountering a cheater or a could-be are so high that I don't think I can name a single time it's happened in my 200 hours of play. Ever.  That's not to say cheating is the only technical problem. A year after the game left early access and it's still a technically unsound, bug-riddled MESS in every aspect, from gunplay to vehicles to animations. The game is an unoptimized piece of ♥♥♥♥, a problem which has only gotten worse. I use an R9-380 and FX8320 with 16 gigs of ram, totalling out at a solid machine. Playing on the lowest dirt settings where the game looks like a mobile port. The loading screens still occasionally take longer than the opening lobbies or even the entire plane ride for dropping. Distance models are frequently present upon landing, and loot doesn't load in sometimes for more than 30 seconds after I hit the ground, but only for me or anyone else affected - if you're fortunate enough to load the game in time, you have full access!  But of course, it's too limiting to say that the game's problems are limited to ONLY bugs, since there's also a slew of poor choices from PUBG corp to back up the idea. Why do players make less noise when they take their shoes off? Why are so many of the weapons noob traps? Why doesn't everyone spawn with a pistol? Why is this game so determined to be absolutely random in how it assigns weapons and gear?  The microtransactions and loot boxes are not just unnecessary, not just added post launch, not just insulting as a concept and in their implementation into this mess of a game, but downright compromise any progression experience the game offers because of it. The loot boxes that this game added undermine the core experience so severely that if you are interested in playing more than a couple games, you're shelling out anywhere from 5-15$ a week to be able to purchase keys for the rewards that you EARNED, most of the drops are either disgustingly ugly or completely unnoticable.  And none of this is even TOUCHING on the fundamental gameplay formula, which alternates between long periods of extensive all-encompassing boredom, and moments of life-or-death gameplay where if you were unfortunate enough to stop paying attention during that 10-minute run into the circle, you are killed instantly.  If I could, I would go back and stop myself from ever buying a copy of this game, and put that money towards anything else on my wish list. I'd put it towards gas in my car, or a couple of pizzas. The idea of PUBG being so successful is so emblematic of the gaming industry as a whole - successful despite being fundamentally broken, unoriginal, not fun to play, and in return for making billions, the developers implemented wave after wave of loot boxes instead of fixing it.  PUBG is fundamentally broken and anti-fun to play in every respect. If you read this, please, go buy something - literally anything - else instead.",209.0,Not Recommended,487
578080,2022-02-24 00:00:00,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",17.0,Recommended,324
578080,2018-06-16 00:00:00,"I go back and forth so much on this game, but ultimately I don't think it's polished or competitive. It's not a game of skill and thought. It's ""Who has the best rig"" vs. ""Who can anticipate the lagginess of the game"".  It's not polished. It takes a tremendous machine just to make the game playable at all. And it's not stable, it'll kick you out in the middle of a game without warning.  The only real enjoyment I get is from playing with friends. If you don't have someone who specifically wants to play the game with you you aren't going to have a good time. You'll run around for 20 minutes collecting loot for the person who kills you without you seeing them.  It's not a game in the sense that you want to win. The goal is to ruin someone else's game. Because every kill is a frustration for someone, every death is a chore of ""well, now I have to do all that ♥♥♥♥ again.""  The real game is the last 10 people. Everything else is just random time filler where you probably won't see anyone. You're just running in an emtpy field looking for the one (of a dozen) weapons that you can win with.  And ultimately, I just can't reccomend the game. It's too unrefined, it's too frustrating to play, and the only payoff is the knowledge that you ruined someone else's night.  EDIT: So after a six month break with the game I decided to pick it up again. The first two or three hours of that was trying to resolve a glitch where I was unable to run after aiming down gun sights. I ended up wiping my controller configuartions and re-installing the game. That seems to have worked.  Disregarding that there are a few things that have changed since my review. New maps, new guns, but the biggest change of all is in performance. My gun hits what it's aiming at instead of what the server thinks I'm aiming at. That's a massive plus to the game.  Ultimately though I still stand by my old review. The core of the game is frustration and unless you have a friend who specifically wishes to play with you I can't reccomend the game.",85.6,Not Recommended,246

578080,2017-09-30 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Let me tell you 1.why PUBG experienced a lot negative reviewes in these days and 2.why I give a negative review for this game.  1. Most negative reviews in these days were given by Chinese players. PUBG published an in-game advertisement of a third-party gaming VPN for them. This is the first time I saw an third-party advertisement in a “Non-F2P” game.  Of cause this is not the worst part. The worst part is, after the new patch update, most of Chinese players cannot connect to the server like before. Renting that gaming VPN seems to be the only choice for them to play this game.  So, it is obvious that PUBG limited the players who have already paid for this game to connect to the server and discriminates all Chinese players.  That gaming VPN also increase rent fees after they publish the advertisement in the game.  2. From my perspective, this game is a fun game, but it is not a great game. You can have fun here, but you can not “research” or “go deep”. The high randomness of this game highly decreases the competitiveness which is not helpful for long term development of a game.  The optimization is also a huge problem. After the new update, I experienced a high FPS drop. Server also became unstable. The advantage of a high-end pc also became more and more obvious.  Although each gameplay is different, I also feel boring sometime because the weakness in player-player interaction. Two situation I mostly encountered are ambushing an enemy and geting killed by hide enemies.  Hence, I don’t recommend this game for competitive players and the players who would like to “research” and “master” the game. If you just want to have some fun or play with your friends, this game is also a fair choice for you.  However, Please aware that PUBG will not consider your interest as a player since they just sold their Chinese player community to a third-party gaming vpn and force them to buy this vpn.",43.3,Not Recommended,100

578080,2022-03-30 00:00:00,"On 03/29/2022, at approximately 1952 hours, I decided to type a review for PUBG: Battlegrounds.  It seems every time I login in I observe several messages stating that the players I reported for cheating from pass games had been banned. Yes, you may be thinking, wait that is a good thing that they are actually reviewing reports but the fact is players are able to continue to cheat and win games from you, and it ruins the experience.  Normally, I would continued to get into a match with a friend. We would win a chicken dinner, and would feel like the game had improved. Thinking it had possibly less cheaters. Boy would we be wrong. Next matches that would follow would have several suspicious deaths, and some top 10's. I'd say at least every three games you would find out cheaters killed you while spectating. You will observe them either using radar or ESP. Some will even be so bold that they will aimbot instant headshots. You will report them and wake up the next day seeing they were banned and repeat the above.  Normally I'm able to met okay teammates that are willing to work together even if the team doesn't all speak the same language (which seems to also happen every three rounds). Oh and some reason they always want to update or do maintenance right when everyone with 9-5 jobs get home and settled in.  Oh they also have bots that randomly shoot and wear dino outfits majority of the time and shoot randomly sometimes hitting you which ""YAY"" free kill but it makes it feel like the game is dying which it maybe is.

578080,2017-09-29 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Honestly I thought I would really enjoy this, but that is not the case.  It's buggy as hell. I appreciate it's still early access but they've got the funding. They have a button on the main page to 'refresh the UI incase it's buggy'. If that isn't an indicator of what to expect I don't know what is.  Performance is terrible. People with modest rigs still suffer from poor fps.  It's so clunky. Things you can't walk up or climb over are just beyond frustrating. Putting your gun to a window or over a desk prevents you from doing so. When you think you're picking up ammo off the floor, you end up picking the gun instead, you switch back but then have to reload the gun again, even though it was previously loaded.  The maps are so large half the time it feels like a walking simulator. You spend 50% of your time staring at the floor for items, 49% walking and 1% shooting.  The general gun mechanics are strange. There's been several times I've pumped a full round into someone (the blood spats are an indicator it hit) and the player is still alive and shoots you dead in one. Other times I've shot someone with a shotgun from 25 meters away and killed them in 1 hit.  The devs themselves are poor too and act like children. It's just a massive cash cow now. Here's why: - Bringing in micro transactions during early access is just unethical especially after the amount it's made in sales, there's no excuse. - Bringing in micro transations when they clearly stated they didn't. So that was a massive lie. - They ban people for stream sniping and even those that aren't. There's no care for their players. They support the streamers because it's their way of marketing and getting more sales. - They ban people from their forum that have posted a polite opinion. - They cry when another company ""steals"" their idea, even though battle royale style games has been around for years.",41.9,Not Recommended,1835

Originally written on Jan 30th, 2018.  Sept. 29th, 2018 update: Hackers are still as present as ever, just in the last game I played I watched a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instantly headshot 8-10 people without ever aiming downsight from 200-300 meters away.   The problem is still a strong mixture of the Chinese playerbase's rampant abuse of hacks and the devs doing absolutely nothing to fix the problem. Despite the ""fix PUBG"" campaign they have rolled out hackers are as common if not more common than ever with it being easy to find 5-6 per game by spectating after death, all of them always being Chinese.  Not to mention the other downside now being the long queue times thanks to the playerbase dying due to the previous paragraph's issues. When I first wrote this review there were 3 million players daily, now there is less than a million on average. You know something is dreadfully wrong with the game when it loses 66+% of its playerbase in 8 months.  Avoid this game like the plague and you will be better off.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TL;DR - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase. - TL;DR   I've got quite a few hours in this game, not enough to be a no-life but enough to know how it is. Let me break some things down for you about this game.   It's almost unplayable. The sheer number of cheaters (literally almost all if not all are from China) has been growing steadily for over a month. Ever since more and more Chinese players have migrated to the North American servers the population of cheaters has skyrocketed. Allow me to list what will happen to you regularly:  - You will join a lobby and all you will hear is a dozen plus voices shouting in Chinese with the occasion expletive in English. - You will drop and find supplies as normal - You will run in to a solo/group/duo/etc. as expected - Instead of banter during the firefight all you hear is shrieking and yelling in Chinese (They talk in-game A LOT for some reason) - You will be instantly shot in the head after you leave cover (often before too) by somebody who was 100 meters+ away and was not even aiming down their sights, just hip firing. - You will be angry that you were killed by a cheater - You will take a break for a few minutes - You will go back to the top of this list.  Literally of the last 5 games I have played 4 of my 5 deaths have been to Chinese who were cheating on the North American servers. I will tell the story of the last death.  Partner and I were on a rooftop picking up a couple items, I see two players brazenly jogging down the middle of the road, one not wearing pants (A telltale sign it is a Chinese player), and tell my partner to get ready to attack them. At this point we have not at any point crested the barrier between us, but the enemy player in front of the duo has been looking directly at my position on a roof in the middle of town the whole way down the road. I told my partner to shoot and within a half second of him standing and taking his first shot he was knocked on the ground, I had also stood up when I said to shoot and I was on the ground almost instantly after my partner. Watching the death cam revealed the instant we both stood up the same player headshot both of us, while running, while firing from the hip. Their target reticule was as large as it could possibly be, yet they managed to hit both of us in the head twice in less than a second at 50 meters while moving and not aiming.  You could think it was a wildly lucky shot, but when the same scenario has happened twice before tonight alone, it isn't coincidence that all the players doing this magical shots are all Chinese and assuredly cheating.  I'm not bad at the game, I have multiple wins under my belt, I know what a good player acts like, and none of the Chinese players who kill me act like that.   The game is broken. Not because of in-game glitches or errors (of which there are more than a few, freezing on start is a big one) but because there are hundreds of thousands of cheaters, literally. The developers of the game have openly admitted that a vast majority of the cheating players are Chinese, but sternly refuse to region lock the game and keep the Chinese players on the Chinese servers. They claim it is ""unfair"" to keep the ""good players"" out because of ""a few bad eggs"" However a ""few bad eggs"" is the majority of over 1,500,000 banned cheaters. It is more unfair to the few Chinese players that do not cheat to be forced to play with all their cheating brethren than it is to the entirety of the EU, NA, SA, SEA, etc. communities and players, who are all burdened by the massive influx of cheaters from a single region.   I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase.",448.1,Not Recommended,67

578080,2017-09-28 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I BOUGHT THIS GAME FULL PRICE AND YOU GIVE ME IN GAME ADS!!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU BLUEHOLE!!!!  For those who do not understand what I'm talking about, I'm a Chinese player and seemingly Bluehole get parterned up with some 'game accelerator' software and put an ad ON THE LOBBY SCREEN. (Basically a VPN software that makes you connect to the game faster)  It says 'The only official accelerator of the game'..  The ad appears only if you connect from China, so it wouldn't be a problem for players elsewhere, but why did Bluehole even approved this? They are already charging full price for an early access game and now they put ads in it. What kind of developer do this?  ----------------------------Oct.19-------------------------------- UPDATE: Bluehole has ended the partnership with the accelerator software on Oct.5. The ad has been removed since then. Those who accuse me of spreading disinformation, check your sources.  Okey, I never expected so many people would be reading this review. I think I should clearify a few things:  1. There is no Chinese server. ever. Bluehole tells who is a 'Chinese' player based on his ip. As long as Bluehole saw you as 'Chinese', the ad showed up no matter which server you tried to connect to. (Again, the Ad has been removed so nobody is going to see it anymore)  2. It's not all about the Ad, it's about their bussiness model. Instead of fixing their game and their servers, they are already thinking about ways to abuse their popularity for profit. Remember the time when they sold Gamescon Keys?  3. What's the hate about? I am just a player who happens to be Chinese. I bought the game and I played fair, so I believe I have the right to complain. I don't want to mention the R word but please do not judge other people by on their nationality or ethnics. btw Bluehole is a Korean (which means, Asian) company.  4. I admit 30$ is not a big price given most recent AAA games are selling at 60$ and many have all kinds of season pass & day one dlc & microtransactions kind of stuff. I wouldn't have any problems if they add microtransactions after the game is officially released. But in-game ads really grossed me out. Seriously. This is not a f2p game.  Gameplay-wise I totally enjoyed the game, it's the quetionable decision of the developers that prompted me to write this review.

578080,2017-11-25 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW PUBG ------------------------ While PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS can occasionally be an obscene amount of fun with friends, this game has so many issues that it borders on the unbelievable and in many cases it walks a fine line that teeters on the unacceptable. This review is far too long and blocky in text, so for those who like TDLRs, theres a non-specific and ""short"" summary. On the other hand, for those who are OK with reading into this game's issues, I'll go into some standout specifics from Developer conduct to this game's notorious plethora of technical issues and shortcomings, alongside some more casual observations made from someone who has put way WAY too much time into this trainwreck of a game that I just absolutely love to hate...  some may say! others may say! And to be frank, this game is, at first, really something else to experience! Its tense! Its thrilling! It encourages teamplay, coordination and callouts in duos and squads in ways many games simply dont! And cooking your first, second, fifth and twentieth chicken dinners can make for a truly memorable time! However, after the initial 'honeymoon' phase is over, the game starts to show its true colors and the tape and glue that are used to hold together this mess of a game only become more and more transparent with time. If you and a group of friends want to play together, and you have a PC that can run it (basically 3+GB of VRAM w/ ~10+GB of system RAM; CPU isn't as huge a factor with this game), then you may find enjoyment with PUBG until the aformentioned honeymoon phase passes. If you want to play it but may not have others to play it with and don't need to scratch at that Arena-Style itch, then I'd look elsewhere.  Either way, should you choose to pick it up, chances are you will likely find yourself getting frusterated with the game more often than not once that blissful phase of elated innocence passes and the bad really starts to poke out from this mangled heap of broken mechanics peiced sloppily together with duct-tape and glue...  As for the specifics, lets start with the devs backing PUBG ("""", or more specifically, their newly expanded subsidiary known as ) who have made some pretty questionable decisions and statements throughout their games' time in Early Access. Such statements and decisions include the likes of:      Suffice it to say the devs have had plenty of issues with their darling of a game and certainly haven't done much to make most consumers flock to their side. While consumers (that means you!) ought to know if the devs of a game do stuff that could be considered in violation of basic pro-consumer ideologies, none of this dictates the playability of the game, which we are going to dive into right about now!  This game is an absolute mess, technically speaking. Lets get the blunt and obvious out of the way. If you have 2GB VRAM or 8GB system RAM or lower, you should seriously look into buying a different game, or at the very least, read up on the issues this game has ('' is the short of it) when it comes to not having enough RAM / VRAM. As for other technical issues, here's what 400+hrs of my own personal gametime alongside experiences shared with friends has equated to:              Its been nearly a year since this game was put up on Early Access. As others have said, seeing PUBG go the way of games like H1Z1 & DayZ is not too far-fetched at this point, especially given the suprising lack of talk beyond PUBG's ""1.0"" release, which kind of feels like the last big thing this game may see. And that sort of breaks my heart, because despite PUBG being an absolute mess that is barely being held together, there are some moments this game has given me that no other game can rival. But between the devs and their actions, and the countless bugs and crashes I've endured, I can not recommend this game to anyone right now. It may be worth looking at when they exit Early Access sometime in the upcoming months, but until then, consider staying clear, especially if you have a budget PC.",663.3,Not Recommended,2388

578080,2019-08-26 00:00:00,"PUBG is one of those rare, hidden gems that actually gets worse as time goes on. In the beginning, everything was fine. The game was playable, for the most part: it may have been riddled with server issues and a lack of optimization, but it was fun! The one map it had was slowly being refined, and as Early Access drew to an end and 1.0 approached, promises of an all new, even better map were frequently made. And then they added microtransactions before the game even left early access, in the form of the same cosmetic crates that CS:GO had. Needless to say this left a bitter taste in the mouth of some longtime fans, as the devs had promised before that microtransactions wouldn't even be discussed until after the game left Early Access. Still, these items had no impact on gameplay outside of the normal gamer need to show off your FABULOUS fashion collection to every other play you see. And then they turned off the marketplace completely, meaning now it was no longer possible to trade cosmetic items at all, no hope of ever obtaining the ever-allusive schoolgirl attire or movie-inspired yellow tracksuit outside of dumping thousands of dollars into lootcrates and the keys required to open them. Eventually the marketplace would return, but many of the most desirable items are now strictly non-tradeable. Shortly before the 1.0 launch the game received some desperately needed optimization and bug fixes, giving hope to the game's now record-breaking playerbase, however the game still had many, many technical issues. Even worse, with the influx of new players came a rise in cheaters. Even as I write this years past the exodus from Early Access, the game has received precious little in the way of optimization. It's playable, but it's nowhere near the level of polish it should have after so much time spent soaking up player funds. In all, the developers of the game have long since abandoned any pretext of actually listening to what the playerbase wants. Every now and then we get maybe some new cosmetics we can purchase with real-world money from the cash shop, but none of the gameplay or QOL improvements that we've been asking for since the beginning. My chief complaint with the game's current state actually has it's source in the game's best selling point. Credit where credit is due: the developers have been pumping out fresh new maps in a way other games in the Battle Royale genre don't dare. We've gone from having 2 maps at launch to now having 4 fresh, diverse maps each with their own unique themes and play styles. With the 1.0 Launch and the arrival of the second map, we were given the highly-sought-after map select feature. And then they replaced that with a ""Playlist"" select feature, as they launched a third map some months later. So now your choice was either the new 3rd map, or a random selection between the first 2 maps. Needless to say, the reaction to this was lukewarm. Why was this needed? I can't say for sure, but I imagine the developers were unhappy with how many players still preferred the original map over the two newer offerings. So now they've added a feature universally loved only to take it away and replace it with a shallow, useless copy. It was at this point that I quit playing PUBG all together. I no longer felt as if the developers cared for their players at all and merely saw the game, and the people who play it, as an endless source of income, a project they could give minimal work to while ensuring profits, and of course their own continued employment. I returned to PUBG recently in the late Summer of 2019 to see where the game currently stood. It has changed, somewhat, and not for the better in my opinion. There is now a cash shop where you can buy your cosmetics directly if you don't have the patience or funds to keep buying keys to open the lootcrates, and of course there are many different varieties of crates, with their own keys, to ensure that the whales who keep buying microtransactions don't spend money on just one thing, but several. The map select is gone entirely. When you prepare to queue for a match, your only option is ""Random Map"", containing the 4 current maps, and virtually guaranteeing that you won't actually get to play the map you want to play, when you want to play it. Once inside an actual match, the only real changes toward gameplay I noticed were some instances of UI bloat, as keybinds now feature directly on the screen, and some changes to the initial drop taken from Fortnite, like the ability to press a button to glide or fast descent, as well as new UI art for the airspeed and heading elements. Once on the ground, the game plays exactly the same. A few art assets had been changed, although I wouldn't say they were necessarily better than they were before. Certain houses had wallpaper on the walls where before they had been plain wood, some doors now looked a bit more defined than they had been before. I played a few rounds in a row, and then I uninstalled the game once more. All in all I have to say that PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds is a special milestone in the history of the BR genre, but not one that's needed moving forward. There are other games out there now that handle better, play better, and perform better. PUBG has somewhat stiffer controls than other games you might be used to playing now, far worse optimization, stability issues, an over-priced cash shop, and an aesthetic that is wholely boring and unoriginal with it's washed-out colors and dirty browns and beiges. I can't recommend it at all, it'll only get worse from here.",269.4,Not Recommended,151

578080,2018-03-04 00:00:00,"Why actually improve the game when you've already sold millions! In reality there are so many issues with the game; I'll give an example of stuff as I go.  It's buggy as all hell - I've gotten stuck so frequently on things that are in the game to serve no purpose except to just be a hinderance to players. Have frequently had sound bugs, have frequently lost health from parachuting, small and large amounts, looting bugs where you pull something in your inventory or click to grab it and it won't get picked up regardless of weight.  The servers are actual trash - Frequently in this game I have been in a fire fight to feel I was unfairly killed. I'll die after I'm out of sight for a solid second or two from someone who shoots me, will get shot from people who aren't peeking and haven't been for a while, and just flat out have bullets hit me and not damage me at all and vice versa shoot people, see blood come out and have it do nothing to them.  The optimization is horrendous - It's sad to say that most average - above-average computers can not run this game. Without having a streamer-quality PC it's hard to really feel like you're getting the full experience out of the game based on the lacking of optimization in the game. Having graphics on super low and still getting hardly any fps is rather sad. Something to note on this is the absurd amount of useless junk within the game itself. Broken down cars that have actually no use and that are everywhere, tall buildings where half the building is blocked off by useless junk in the staircase to prevent you from going further, etc. I would think there's two ways to go about this. Leave it all in as is and implement the game to use those assets being rendered in and ignored (instead of broken down police cars having nothing anywhere near them maybe give them item spawns??), or clean it up and see if maybe removing some of the absurd amount of unused accessories will boost up the optimization a bit? Both are unlikely, because why improve the game when you can just add more stuff to keep it ""interesting"" and keep people ""hyped"" about new releases.  Hackers are rampant, and that's after tons of chatter of bans - It's absurd the amount of hackers that are running around in the game and seemingly nothing is ever getting done about them.  The only real positive for the game that I can really say is that it's got a more serious feel than other Battle Royals, but even still it's just not worth the time or bother to play. You can have fun with some friends and enjoy yourself on it but it's never satisfying or enjoyable based on the gameplay or game, it's always because of the company and jokes you're experiencing the game with.",260.3,Not Recommended,79

I've read Tencents article of what their ""doing"", but it clearly isn't working. The reporting system and actions taken against hackers is a venom \ antidote game that's unnecessarily evolved to mutually benefit one another. The resurgence of hacker accounts only yields more profit to Tencent, so why would they fix a problem that their revenue team would consider as ""not broken"". In the wake of other better survival games, it appears that their greed and ignorance is what's keeping them from thriving in a way that benefits their community. Their lack of innovation for in-game detection and the innumerable presence of hackers in all game modes is inexcusable for a game whose community is this large. Don't take just my word for it. Look at all the recent negative reviews and what the community is telling you. Don't buy this game. Don't waste your time or money. Thanks for listening.",335.3,Not Recommended,75

578080,2023-02-27 00:00:00,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠿⠿⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢺⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠆⠜⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⠛⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⡏⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⣦⣤⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⢠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢿⡧⠇⢀⣤⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾⣮⣭⣿⡻⣽⣒⠀⣤⣜⣭⠐⢐⣒⠢⢰⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣏⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⣾⣿⠂⢈⢿⣷⣞⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣽⣿⣿⣷⣶⣾⡿⠿⣿⠗⠈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠻⠋⠉⠑⠀⠀⢘⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⢹⣿⣿⡇⢀⣶⣶⠴⠶⠀⠀⢽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⠀⠀⠣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡟⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣧⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⣴⠁⢘⡙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠙⢿⠗⠂⠄⠀⣴⡟⠀⠀⡃⠀⠉⠉⠟⡿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢷⠾⠛⠂⢹⠀⠀⠀⢡⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠛⠿⢿",27.7,Recommended,199

578080,2017-04-17 00:00:00,"*Edited at Patch 27 release and post Apex release* The more competition shows up against PUBG the more PUBG shows it's flaws and issues. Fundamentally it cannot be fixed, PUBG at its core is what presents itself as the challenge to being a fluid, solid competitive shooter. Movement is slow to loot, react, and maneuver. Inertia is handled poorly, this all shows itself in vaulting, looting, shooting, jumping, and running around. PUBG shines wonderfully in shooting mechanics and bullet physics but drops dead in the water when it comes to allowing tactile movement by allowing far too many positions for you to be opened up by being shot during an action you can't control. (Vaulting that ends up slowly stepping over a ledge, recovering and redirecting inertial movement from running into an object, maneuvering around obstacles in general feeling sluggish.) This is not to say PUBG needs to feel like Apex, to feel like Blackout, to feel like Battlefield, but to be re-written with the physics of movement in mind. Just jump in game for a perfect example, running through water and jumping through molasses anyone?  (Post note: The following has been written prior to my learning about optimization on my own end, server issues around patch dates, and info from Reddit that's SUPER helpful.)  BRUH. You want anxiety and a rush and a solid feel of accomplishment?! This is your titties and cream. This is super early alpha so OPTIMIZATION DOES NOT EXIST YET.

All these strategies worked for people. The mid-game was quiet, I have often seen or heared no one till there were only 20 people left. I have to say, that my favourite strategy back then was ""I drop far far away and dont`t go to the cities"", so this could have been a side effect, and other people would see this different. But nonetheless I liked it, how it was. It was a great game!  But then... then they made the first adjustments to the blue zone. It wasn`t much and back then, I thought it was to optimize things for all of us. But I was wrong! For the last half year they made many ""small"" adjustments to the zone (faster starting, more damage, more DOT the further you are away) to get PUBG ready for e-sports. Nearly everything in this matter was to appease the e-sports community, which wanted a faster gameplay, because the old was to boring for the spectators. I feel sad about this and it angers me a lot, that because of a small part the whole PUBG community has to suffer. That the loudest in the community are probably fast-paced-shooter-lovers, who cry ""faster, faster, faster!"", make it even worse, because all the other voices who liked the game how it was, were drowned in the loud ones.  And now.... update #10. I have already played some matches with the new update and I have to say, that I DON`T LIKE it! Sometimes I wasn`t even at the ground when the first timer was already ticking! How should I loot if I have to move instantly to get to the zone?! Maybe I`ll have time then... oh sorry 2nd zone starts in 90s (200s before), you need to go! Oh, you`ve taken damage? You are at the edge of the blue? You need to heal? No time! 3rd circle starts in 60s (150s before) and you have far to go! If you are unlucky and the first zone is far away and you have no car, you can probably give up, because you will most likely not be able to reach the circle before it moves again. And since they added extra damage the further you are outside the circle... RIP...  Also with this update, there isn`t any time for tactics anymore. Dropping far away, thinking how you engage an enemy or attack a building takes too much time. You will have to move before you can do it. In addition, they increased the chance that the new circle is in the center of the old one, even the last circle will shrink to the middle! They took away the last bit of fairness in this game. Now everybody will go for the middle because the circle will probably be there. What will come next? I don`t want a game where I can make a list of what I'll have to do next! This is just boring. If I wanted a boring game, I wouldn`t have bought it!   Please undo at least the horrible changes to the zone you did in update #10! I WANT MY OLD PUBG BACK!!!  edit 14.04.2018: I really apreaciate it, that the devs undid the changes to the zone! I also hope that next time, they put big changes like these much longer to the test servers than for update #10, so that something like this won`t happen again.  Maybe try the slower zones as in #10 and zone 2 with 180s, zone 3 with 120s, zone 4 with 90s and the rest like #10 with 60s cooldown. That is a bit faster but should be enough time to loot and fight. And one solution for those who like a faster game/copetitive mode would be extra servers. So you could choose if you want to play on normal mode or the faster e-sports mode.  edit 25.01.2020: I wanted to give the game one more chance, so I played it with a friend. Well... I tried. Because somehow I couldn't even play it on very low graphics, although it was fluently playable at medium settings for me, when I left in summer 2018. Now 30 Euros are completly burnt for a game that I can't even play anymore. Pretty good job so far guys.....",455.2,Not Recommended,216

It runs far better than it used to, and every patch seems to bring more and more improvements. However, there is one glaring problem: Chinese hackers.  NA servers are INFESTED with Chinese hackers. I never noticed the issues until recently, perhaps with the implementation of the kill cam. My partner and I are top .5% in duos, and the game is borderline unplayable at times. Half the time we get killed, it is by someone with a name like 'ahskf5834732843' or 'lin-feng-838912839'. Upon review of the kill cam, they are tracking us through walls and snapping straight to where we are even when there is no possible way they knew where we were that fast! The event that caused me to write this review was someone killing us both from 400+ yards away with an iron sights AKM WITHOUT LAYING OFF THE TRIGGER. Chinese hackers are sucking the fun out of this game.

578080,2017-08-04 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW As much as I like this game and the whole concept of battle royale game mode is really intresting I think PUBG really did a good job of bringing out the feeling of the battle royale. Basically placing 100 players into 1 world and letting us killing each other to win either with a team of 4 or duo or solo. But then I just can't recommend this game because of its various problems and how the developers is treating the player base.  First off the game itself.. Or just the whole management of the game  First off I will not really blame them for the server issues because handling 1 million plus players does offer some challenges etc but slapping ADS into a game to buy a third party software just to ""boost"" their connectivity to their game servers is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up seriously like wow, they too paid a premium for the game but why is it that after paying for the game they still have to get a third party software to ""boost"" their connectivity to the game servers? isn't the devs of PUBG themselves should take the responsibility and say ""Okay we need more servers for the chinese players""? Honestly I do not care about much about this whole issue because it does not affect me in any way but what if they did this to the English players or the whole player base? "" Oh hey our server can't handle the amount of people so please after buying our game please get a third party ""booster"" software to ""boost"" your connection"" Like what the actual ♥♥♥♥?  The game trailer.. Looks really good am I right? Looks very interesting, so much intense fighting and feels thrilling. Well sadly the game trailer is just full of ♥♥♥♥. The trailer is what you would call glitter over a game. Those fights you seen in the trailer out of 100 games you will probably will only ever experience those fights in like 1 out of your 100 games or totally none at all. Those fight rarely occurs because RNG ♥♥♥♥♥ you over or you will be running for half the game from the blue circle just to be killed be some cheater later on. To put it simply the trailer is just a cool montage to make the game look good.  DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE GAME TRAILER.  It is really bad. I can run the game smoothly at 60FPS but the rendering of textures in this game is just horrible. I won't even say much for this because it is just obvious when you play the game.  If you are wondering what I am running with for this game. It is not the best but I am pretty surely this can run it at a much better rate  - Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500 CPU @ 3.40GHz - Video Card NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - RAM 16 GB - Operating System Microsoft Windows 10 (build 15063), 64-bit   Yes I know it is only for cosmetic purposes and it will not affect the gameplay at all. [ For those people who will say ""hey but its only cosmetics"" ] Adding microtransactions means adding microtransactions and them going back on their word there is no other way around. It is like a lie is a lie no other way around it.  So what this means? In the future anything they promise us like lets say a free new map for example. They can easily go back on their word anytime and say that the new map they promised us to be free will be sold as a DLC :D I mean why not right? They went back on their word on microtransactions and it is so blatant, this means that the Devs dare to go back on their word without fear. Oh not to mention the game is still in EARLY ACCESS filled with a alot of bugs. Oh yes early access with loot crates. Whats next? Needing to open lootcrates to get keys to open other lootcrates? Well if it really comes from this game I won't be surprised at all.    In this game it is so hard to get first place basically winning and the cheaters is getting extremely out of hand. Aside from fighting other 95 + other players you still have to deal with cheaters!! In the early stages there weren't many cheaters but after some time they grew and there seem to be nothing has been done to put a stop to them. Right now literally every game there is usually 1 cheater lurking just having extreme speed [ The most common I see so far that is obvious ] or just ""aimbotting"". Just goto youtube and search you can see lots of them.   Was in a team of 4, 1 dead and 3 was alive and 3V1. Me and 2 other friends was alive. [ Note my team was all at 80% HP ] I was downed by a burst fire from far range [ 4 shots from AKM downed me instantly ] But managed to get revived. I found it very suspicious but i doubted there was a cheater. People do hit lucky shots once in a while. But this is where things gets very obvious. Final circle came and then the opponent just killed all 3 of us in an instant and all of us were behind cover. And game over just like that. You can say oh we are just bad it is up to you to think what you want but lets be real here you will know someone is cheating when somthing so stupid happens like in my case all 3 of us dies behind cover at the same time instantly. Like if I were to die when peeking ok the opponent may be just be very skiled but no all 3 of us were behind cover.  For those who still says you have not encountered cheaters, well good for you but play the game more and you will encounter them sonner or later.    Just plain disappointed and disgusted at its practices in this game and how the player base is getting treated.",171.8,Not Recommended,44

Anyone will tell you it doesn't deserve it, and anyone who votes for it is living a lie.  Unoptimised, poor hacker control, boundless amount of glitches. The only satisfying thing about PUBG is landing a multikill, making a long ranged kill, and winning.  For every satisfying moment, there is 700 unsatisfying moments to follow it.  For a game that looks like ass, you need a supercomputer to run it and even then desync issues are the games downfall.  If you're looking through the reviews and want an honest opinion on buying this game, here's your answer; don't. Until Bluehole actually decides to do something about the hackers and poor optimisation you are better off playing Fortnite Battle Royal (Which by the way I don't even like and I'm STILL recommending it) because it's completely free, 100% optimised for even low end rigs and the developers actually seem to give a ♥♥♥♥ about feedback.  Bluehole, instead of trying to take them to court you should be learning from them about how to actually make a polished game. Until you do, I'll continue to fight against your nomination for GOTY. You don't deserve it.

This game consumed me for many many months while I was in university and the lack of good anti-cheat system is bewildering. They release weekly updates on thousands of accounts that get banned and IP addresses that also get banned, but we still see that cheating goes rampant in this game.  The new system of rotating the maps seems like a good idea but its restricting as 70% of the the time we still just play the original map. DONT GET ME WRONG, OG IS BEST BUT.... I don't ONLY wanna play that when there are over than 7 maps created which allow for a lot more diversity.  But let me finish strong. the game jsut isn't what it used to be at launch. It went downhill ever since then, new BRs came out and PUBG just lagged behind in content without bringing anything new out that was creative. They sat on the ""realism"" of the gunplay and then just never expanded on the game. Also, don't forget about the kids who never went outside to touch grass and have been playing for the last 5 years and just instantly laser beam you from the other side of the map without any ability to counterplay.  EDIT, why'd they remove controller support for all of you? This developer is wild but I agree with the K&M only style of gameplay. Y'all need to goto back to Fortnite. Stop whining.

578080,2019-07-08 00:00:00,"This Game is getting worse and worse since the 1.0 release. Yes, they fixed some bugs. But they also introduced a ton of new buggy mechanics, as well as an ingame store for even more cashgrab, instead of fixing the game. Cheaters are still a very common sight.  The game's netcode is utter trash, and so are their EU servers. Latency changes drastically each time you connect to a new match. 26ms, 50ms... sometimes you get a server with over 100ms ping. Even if you have a server with low latency, there is still about 3-10% packet loss every now and then. (I'm sporting a stable 400mbit cable connection, no problems of that kind with any other online game)  The game mechanics, especially the weapon/hitbox physics are horribly unreliable. Shoot someone in the face (aiming) with revolver 2 Meters away: under 20% damage to their healthbar. (Lag? Spread?) Shoot and visibly hit someone 4 times to the chest with SKS, they just turn around and oneshot you with M4 or Scar from 50 Meters away (twoshot, if you are wearing lv2 armor and lv2 helmet, and of course their first two spray shots hit and knock you out instantly) A squadmate once shot (and hit) someone THRICE with M24 and that guy was still running.  The worst thing in my opinion is the totally inaccurate Killcam, which isn't even barely in sync with what a player has done, seen or aimed at. My Squad got at least two cheaters banned by report, but most of the time it is just impossible to tell if someone was playing fair because the killcam is doing wierd moves, or lagging behind the actual movement. (Even CoD4: Modern Warfare had an accurate Killcam 10 years ago)  Another thing that bugs me a lot is the discrepancy of audible noise between your instance and the server.

Recent reviews have been miserable because players are overreacting. A lot. Yes, the game has issues as of now. It is not yet well optimized. It does have hackers and cheaters. There are still bugs around. All three of these issues must be mentioned. But: The game is early access and the developers (as every developer team would, of course) are saying they're working on optimization. Right now they're pushing for the first stable version, they call it PC1.0, coming out in a few weeks. For a lot of players that behave a little like toddlers that's not enough, they want daily optimization updates. Hackers/cheaters are getting banned every day. By the thousands and tenthousands. The bugs I encounter have not cost me my life over the last few weeks anymore, the physics are sometimes still wonky -especially in cars- but they're fun as heck.

Permadeath in a multiplayer shooter was besides in CS and in some poor implemented battelroyale-games almost extinguished on the market. PUBG brings this adrenaline packed feeling back, as you continuously have the feeling of ""every new round counts"". As a result, a big niche on the market was filled - PUBG has been sold more than 40,000,000 times. But in total the development feels kind of stuck. New modes/maps/changes are implemented too slowly. And for keeping the audience, they either have to implement randomly generated city location-spawns on the maps, or release a new map every 2-3months. Anyways you can have adrenaline rushed fun for at least 100hrs without getting bored.

Vehicles are nowhere to be found either.

578080,2017-08-05 00:00:00,"Be careful of the purely negative reviews telling you not to buy the game. The ""microtransactions"" they are talking about are going to charity and the winner of a tournament as well as the production of said tournament.  So this uproar is over a voluntary situation, where people can choose to spend their money on in-game cosmetic items with the proceeds going to charity and a tournament. There are legitimate concerns, to be sure, but that should not warn people from getting into what is clearly the MP Game of the Year for 2017. Cosmetic microtransactions have zero impact on gameplay. They should also have no impact on your decision to purchase this game right now. $30 for a game I have gotten more out of than any AAA title in years, including the Battlefield series.  BTW, most people playing at one time, over 600,000! That was this week. Do not listen to these detractors, buy the game and get in here!       Like most of you I was hesitant to purchase this game. Another Early Access title with some janky looking animations as well as some mixed criticism in the ether of Steam's review system. I watched a few streams and bided my time until I felt confident that I was not wasting my money on the chance that it was a good game. I have been head long in the dive ever since and don't expect to hit bottom any time soon.  The numerous paths to enjoying this game range from simply learning how everything works and dying a lot in that process, and I do mean a LOT, to being so overcome with adrenaline, emotion and exhilaration when you win that you can't control your body. The adrenaline dump post win is real and I legitimately wish you feel it every game. This game is a rush!  There are low points to be sure, but they should only be when you find a bug or encounter poor behavior of another player who might be cheating or teaming. These behaviors have not been part of my experience at all in over 400 hours of play. I can not be certain of the cheating to be sure. But because of my perspective, they have not impacted my judgement on the game one bit. This is just something we as gamers on the PCMR have to deal with, so we accept it and move on. Be aware, PUBG has banned 25k cheaters in the past 3 months. It is out there and they are doing their best to fight it.    Life & Death in the PUBG:  You will die, a lot, to things you can not see or hope to control. This is not the extent of the game but the stick hitting you to keep moving so you can grab that carrot. You have that carrot. Obtaining it is solely based on your actions. You decided where to jump from the plane, what buildings to loot, which items to loot, how much you paid attention to the actions of those around you & the circle. It was your decision that put you on the exterior of the map when the circle fell on the other side of it. You choose to move ahead of the next circle so now you only have to cross part of it in the remaining time you have before it closes again. You are the one that did not ""slice the pie"" in your field of vision to spot the guy sitting by the 3rd tree to your right. You are the only one to move you in front of someone else's gun sights. Understand this simple principle so you will have a far better time while enjoying the hell out of this game.  Consider it in the terms of playing Poker. You can learn the game easily enough, but it will take you a lifetime to master. The only thing you can do is learn from your mistakes. Each death is a lesson you can take something away from. Don't repeat your mistakes and you can only get better. Leave the assumption that your death is based on RNG to the uninformed. You are the master of your fate in this game, take control of it.  Gunplay:  Fast, hard hitting bullet physics with a semi-random pattern of recoil on all weapons makes trigger control & skill a strong factor in determining who wins in the end. I suggest you watch on youtube for a clearer understanding of how weapons & their attachments operate. Currently, there is no practice range in game other than the starting island with it's selection of weapons on the picnic tables & buildings. It's easy to fly away from the plane after the drop in order to find a piece of the island to loot & practice recoil control.  They will be adding a new weapon each month. Yes, they have kept this promise so far.  Vehicles:  with more promised on the way. You can use them to extend your drop range from the plane at the start of a game, allowing you the freedom to loot in peace in the early game while everyone is fighting & dying. Leaving you, hopefully, well prepared for the mid to late game. Or it can be your last gasp at getting in the circle before it slowly kills you.  You can fly, 150+ KPH, on the 2 seat bike, do tricks like an X-Games star if you want or ignore them at all costs as they are a loud siren alerting people where to shoot.  Fuel isn't an issue if managed well. Reasonable durability, so they can be destroyed if focus fired by a squad or a m249. Having said all that, they are death traps against a good shooter & should be avoided when possible IMO.  Sound:    The ambient audio can be incredibly deceiving at times, especially to newer players that may not be used to it. 99% of your actions will create an audible que for those around you to take advantage of. I suggest you pay attention to everything you hear, your mind will filter the noise eventually. This will allow you to pick up on the changes in your environment & keep you alive at the end of the day.

I can't reccommend this game to anyone that want depth or choice, especially solo play. Duo's or Group can get a lot deeper but it's still not worth it.  If you just want to drop into a game, not give a damn and just go ham. This is perfect, without a doubt 100% perfect. I would rate this neutral if i could.",20.7,Not Recommended,26

They just want to end the ticket as soon as possible and stay out of trouble.  They never try to solve the cheater problem.  You reported a cheater? ok, the cheater banned for 1 day.

578080,2018-11-21 00:00:00,"So... Pubg... I see alot of negative reviews that are quite frankly somewhat fair and unfair to the product.  I can say having paid for a few keys and the pre-release game that for the $30-$50 that this game has cost me, I have gotten my moneys worth. Over a year of solid online play has been had with friends in squads and thats definitely a ♥♥♥♥-ton of time.  The issues suggested by others are many: 1) Region blocking due to cheats 2) Cheat protection was poor 3) Network Latency/deseync is high and still a problem 4) New content has been very slow to release, maps, guns, etc 5) Poor release schedule on updates, almost always ran long 6) Game seems to have become a skin-engine (like Counter Strike) 7) Map glitches causing damage/movement issues  Some of those issues are with the company and some with the gamer design. Here's the fundamental goods about the game. 1) Methodical paced games. 2) Solid gun play feel and weight 3) Great positional audio/sound work 4) Enjoyable coop feel for a small team 6) 3 large/well placed maps. 7) Decent transport system  Overall I'd say this game when played with a good group of well intentioned fun seekers is still a fun game. Part of the original fun was in the jank from the game and as BlueHole has tried to push this game into a more polished and e-sports-capable state, it has suffered some with the crowd due to the ridiculous nature of deaths and general fun/sillyness dropping away. At this point the game has large flaws, map issues with odd placement of momentum stopping dips, vehicle oddness in movement code, general desync between players engagements, and some basic problems with region protection and cheater prevention.  It is still however fun with a good group of people. Is it worth the price now? I don't know, but I will say that it was for me and I've enjoyed my time with this game. Will I continue to play? Probably because its still relatively enjoyable with the right friends. However I will likely move on eventually to another more polished game due to the slow release and often poorly defined release cycle of the developers game updates. I think it is getting better, but I'm not sure if the future holds any meaningful updates for this game.",1669.8,Recommended,177

578080,2017-09-05 00:00:00,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Hey there, Rebus Forever here with another one minute-ish preview, this time it's the controversy ridden early access release that is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.  Video review available here YouTube™ Video: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds A One Minute-ish Preview.        DId you like Battle Royale? Do you like being killed but not knowing why? Do you like having to develop some god tier skills to consistently do well? Then this might be the game for you.  PlayerUnknown's sees you pitted against a wall of blue gradual death that stalks you across a huge open map you are free explore and bask in the scale of for the first 5 minutes of the match, after which the pursuing blue wall will politely hurry you along by slowly sucking your soul out should you dawdle. Apparently, so I've heard, there are other people in the game- but often my only source of this information is the post death screen that follows some sudden and untraceable gunfire.  PlayerUnknown's is a Battle Royale style game- for anyone unfamiliar with the film, Battle Royale was a feel good rom com that followed the wacky misadventures of a dysfunctional class of school children and their hilarious former teacher on a school trip to the jungle. From there, it's the rom com staple of everyone being forced to kill one another- in this case with nothing more than a supplied backpack of random stuff and whatever they can scrounge- to hilarious and heartwarming effect; rinse and repeat til there is only one person left. PlayerUnknown's is essentially an unlicensed Eastern European themed version of that.  The game can be played in a total FFA mode, and also in squads- if you know enough openly masochistic people. Each game of PlayerUnknown's begins with you waiting in the lobby area until it reaches capacity, during this time you are free to walk around and interact via voice chat with the other players, giving everybody a good opportunity to participate in civil discourse, wish one another the best of luck or exchange tips and advice....... Once the lobby fills the game begins.  For some reason, the devs decided to begin the game with an American Airlines passenger simulator giving you the option to disembark the plane within a set time or removing you by other means if necessary. You begin empty-handed, once on the ground scavenging is the order of the day and then the killing or hiding begins in earnest. The map is huge, to prevent camping and force player interaction (see killing), the map begins shrinking in stages, if you chute down in the wrong place you may well find your only challenge for the game is staying inside the playable area. There is a wide variety of weapons and superficial items littered around with a number of vehicles also added to aid with mobility. Each game continues until there is only one player left.  After each game, you earn some nonsense, game specific currency you can also spend real money on, that allows you to buy lootboxes that might contain a superficial item you might be interested in; the random, almost abusive nature of the loot purchase system, matches the feel of the gameplay perfectly.   (I spent all of my time in FFA mode for context.)  I simultaneously enjoy PUBG, suck at it and think its a little over priced. The games performance is patchy- most of the time when I die I don't know why. I've only made it into the top 10 a handful of times, the devs are now apparently banning people for killing streamers with claims they are doing so without just cause, but if you can pick it up for half price sometime (and have the patience of a saint) PUBG might be the grieving engine for you.

578080,2018-02-24 00:00:00,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS ""PUBG""  is a Battle-Royale, 100-players, Open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.  PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further.  Firstoff all I'm not usually a Battle Royal player, but this game is perfect for my play style. the game is buggy as all hell. Literally anyone that's played this game for more than 2 hours will have run into at least 1 problem.  Let's start off, PUBG does a lot of things right. The gunplay, when it works correctly, is phenomenal. It feels tight and responsive, the bullet physics feel accurate, and especially rewarding when landing long range shots. This is arguably it's strongest suit. The original map that the game launched with 'Erangel' is a great mix of different terrains and hotspots allowing different routes to be taken in order to achieve victory, and is easily the stronger map of the two.  Despite the multitude of things that PUBG gets right, it gets so much wrong. Hackers are a major problem in this game, even after the implementation of PUBG Corp's proprietary Anti-Cheat. Wallhackers, Aimbotters, Norecoil. Hackers are rampant in this game. Ping abuse is another problem. There is a reason you see people spamming #RegionLockChina, and it's not an attempt at racist humour. Not in the slightest. People from countries such as China, tend to join NA and EU servers in order to abuse the fact thaat the desync in this game causes them to be able to demolish people without any issue due to the fact that they are next to impossible to shoot, due to their high ping.  However, none of my complaints matter at the end of the day. I bought the game, PUBG Corp/Bluehole made their money, and that's all that counts at the end of the day. :D  Do I recommend this game? Sure, I guess I do, winning in this game is a sheer adrenaline rush. It's unlike any other game I've ever played.  Do I think you should buy this game? No. Not until this is a stable product, that has a handle on the hackers, has fixed the issues with servers, and has restricted access from players from a high ping locale.",781.6,Not Recommended,28

578080,2024-11-06 00:00:00,"PUBG has been my favorite game since its release—7 years playing on PC, consoles, and mobile! I’ve competed on all platforms, and while I can’t complain about the prizes and organization, what truly frustrates me is the developers’ attitude.  Krafton, the creators of the game, seem to care only about microtransactions, without the slightest concern for fixing or improving fundamental aspects of the game. The new content they add is often unnecessary, while the most critical issues remain unsolved.  The servers are the biggest problem. No matter how good the game is, if the servers don’t work properly, it becomes boring, frustrating, and exhausting. I’ve played in different countries with varying internet speeds, and the difference is obvious. Right now, with 40ms ping, I tested the game with a friend who has 8ms—he effortlessly kills me hip-firing, and it’s his first time playing!  And don’t even get me started on matchmaking. I spend hours searching for matches, especially in ranked, and cheaters are everywhere. It’s ridiculous.   On the other hand what’s up with cheaters/Macros/Wallhacks? Instead of banning them for 1 hour, now it’s 2 hours so they have time to grab some snacks and play more comfortably using just the keyboard?  Have those brilliant anti-cheat developers—who have been trying to implement an AI to detect hacks since 2020—never thought of issuing hardware bans?  Even streamers and content creators use garbage, and you promote it instead. It's disgusting how they keep adding skins instead of weapons, better maps, better gameplay, and MORE WEAPONS.

578080,2020-08-20 00:00:00,"This game is fun, especially with friends, but you'd think that after 4 years of development they'd fix/optimize the game to the point where people can safely play it without having to worry about crashing/lagging even before getting into actual gunfights. You would think that even after porting the game to mobile and console they would actually divert their focus into fixing the un-optimized state that the game is in but to this day nothing has changed.  Not only that the game is horribly un-optimized and that I, and many others have to deal with not even being able to load into the game due to the recent update, they have to cope with player loss by adding bots to the game (Don't tell me that me having to wait in a solos/duo lobby for 10 minutes only to get 20 real players and 80 bots is in the effort to help new players stay alive longer). Don't get me wrong, I like that I can get repetitive and boring challenges done easier over and over by abusing these bots, but that in itself gets stale.  This is the only game that I'm required to actively find more ways to make the game playable by playing around with graphics settings in and outside of the game. Hopefully this game gets better in the future but evident by the recent changes and lackluster efforts in improving stability/performance, I have very low hopes.",200.4,Not Recommended,35
