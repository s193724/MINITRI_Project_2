105600,2019-11-27 00:00:00,"How have I not written a review for this amazing game? I've been playing Terraria ever since the days of early 1.1.1, in the Christmas season of 2011. Over these years, I've logged over 2000 hours total, along with at least another 1000 hours played offline (including playtime on mobile, console, and an alt Steam account). Enough of showing off hour counts though. Why in the world should you buy this game?  Terraria is an experience where you're given basically unlimited liberty. Even before you start, you get to completely customize your character and world. After setting it all up, you get dropped into the center of the overworld, where you can go off to do whatever you want. For those of you who got bored with Minecraft as I did, don't worry, as Terraria completely fixes that problem with branching pathways in weapon classes and self-imposed challenges.  You can even get a vastly different experience, cooperating with friends on an extremely easy to-set-up multiplayer server. By hosting directly through Steam, you just open up your world from the Multiplayer menu and send an invite to your friend(s)! It's that easy! No need for messy port-forwarding or separate third-party accounts (looking at you, Hamachi)!  If your class specific challenges and multiplayer options can't fill your needs, there are tons of really great mods to check out! Thorium and Calamity are two of the biggest ones out there. Thorium blends and balances perfectly with the base game's progression, while Calamity adds some incredibly difficult boss battles and other challenges in higher levels than the progression of the base game (or so I've heard... I'm still blind to most of it). Separately, those two add so much on their own, but there are so many others that can change so many things about the game. Possibilities are endless when it comes to modding in Terraria.  Back to the base game, the music is absolutely outstanding, and along with the ambient noises, the game has an amazing sense of atmosphere. Evil places feel like they're filled with dark energy and horrible power. Underground caverns are filled with anxiety of incoming danger and hope to find loot. The list goes on...  Bosses can be difficult to fight (especially in Expert, and even more so in Master Mode, if you choose to go with that), but the weapons and abilities that you can obtain in Terraria simply make you feel amazing, each one having its own uses. The controls are entirely customizable, even allowing for extra mouse buttons to be used (if you have any), and they're extremely tight. I can't say I've ever seen a more fun grappling hook mechanic than the one in Terraria. It's like a 360-degree hookshot, and the physics feel absolutely perfect on it. There's no better feeling than grappling onto a block and releasing the hook early (by jumping) to launch yourself with some huge momentum (then, if you're like me, doing it again immediately in the opposite direction, and repeating). Mobility might be really slow, and to be honest, a bit boring at the start of the game (in Classic Mode, at least, Journey Mode fixes this nicely), but it greatly improves as you make progress.  Lastly, the Terraria community is one of the best out there. So many helpful folks are in the official Discord Server, if you ever have any questions that the Guide NPC or the thoroughly in-depth wiki site can't answer.  There are many things I didn't cover here, but I don't have time to go into every reason why I love this game (there are too many), and I doubt you have much more time to keep reading them anyways. ;P  Sorry, my train of thought can sometimes go off the rails. Thanks for your time reading this far, and I hope this review was helpful! Hope to see you around in the community! :D  TLDR; This is an utterly fantastic game. Do yourself a favor, and buy it if you somehow haven't yet.","1,606.6",Recommended,"709 people found this review helpful

105600,2017-06-03 00:00:00,"I have played this game for 1,055 hours at the time of writing. This is an amazing game. It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.   EDIT: 1000 hours later re-review (2,123 hours at the time of edit)  This game STILL stands as one of the best games I've played to date.  Journey's End (update 1.4) was a great update, although it didn't change much in the way of over-all game progression, it revamped and/or added to many of the lackluster parts of the game, (ex: bloodmoon fishing, town rework, new mushroom biomes, summoning rework, etc). There was also variety of balancing changes that were introduced with 1.4, which I believe were for the better. Some staple items were nerfed, but still very good. On the other hand, a lot of niche/""bad"" items were reworked or buffed, making them on par (or better) compared to many other items.  It would also be a crime to not mention the modding scene for this game. If you buy this game, do yourself a favor and download tModLoader off of steam, because oh my, there are a lot of great mods out there. Keep in mind that tModLoader isn't 1.4 (yet), but is still a massive blast and a great experience.   Some mods I would heavily recommend are:  Split This mod is my favorite so far, prioritizing quality over content. Everything in this mod is very well made.  Calamity The most popular mod by far, has an AMAZING soundtrack composed by DMDokuro, definitely check out their other work. (and don't forget the music is a separate mod!) Play this mod on expert mode with revengeance rune active for the intended experience!  Thorium This mod adds a musical bard class that buffs you and your allies, so definitely play this one with a squad for the best experience.  Fargo's mods This group of mods adds an 'eternity mode' that will truly unleash hell upon your world, and I don't mean more health and damage for enemies, I'm talking unique mechanics. Changes to all of the bosses AI and some normal enemy AI makes them feel fresh again, the enchantment accessories you can make, and 3 town npcs that you fight as bosses later on (they are seriously well done). You will die a lot, so have patience.  Terraria Overhaul This mod doesn't add much in the way of items or bosses at all, however, it will make Terraria a much different experience. You might not like a lot of what this mod has to offer, and a lot of mechanics can be disabled in the settings, but at least give it a try.  Polarities Polarities is sadly a mod that only works in singleplayer, but what it has to offer in return is an amazing experience. New biomes, bosses, enemies, items, a few new mechanics, and another dimension you can travel to (that can lead to some very interesting sequence breaking in terms of progression), there is a lot this mod has to offer. Definitely give it a try.  and do not forget to get a variety of QoL mods to help you out (1.4 doors, boss checklist, etc.)   Edit 2: more mods to check out (i'll add descriptions later)! (Vanilla hours: 2262; TModloader Hours: 462+ however many i had before it went on steam)  Spirit Shadows of Abaddon Mod of Redemption Elements Awoken The Stars Above Gensokyo (Touhou mod, music addon also has remixes cuz copyright) Starlight River Demo (cool ass looking mod in development, definitely check out the demo) Dragon Ball Terraria (i have never watched dragonball in my life but this mod was kinda fun)","2,562.8",Recommended,"449 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-11-21 00:00:00,"[TL;DR] * Terraria is a highly replayable sandbox RPG and it is fun whether played alone or with friends.  Gameplay: + Progress through the game by defeating bosses. + Defeating bosses unlocks new content. + High player agency, play and progress however you want, at whatever pace you like.  Content: + Contains over 4000 ITEMS in the game to find and play around with, varying from cosmetics to functional equipment and fun silly toys ensuring that every playthrough feel unique. + Not repetitive, it's fun and fresh even after completing it several times. + Offers both a casual experience for casual players and a challenging one for hardcore players. + Only 200mb for hundreds of hours worth of content. (Even more if you like to min max stuff)    [AND NOW, AN ESSAY FOR YOU WEIRDOS THAT LIKE TO READ] (like m-me) * (note: heavily based on my experience, your experience may differ according to your own personal preferences)   [Overview] * I'm fairly casual in comparison to other more hardcore players. I stop playing for a few months after a session or two, but every time I touch this game again (usually on a whim) I just fall in love with it all over again despite having completely finished it several times already. Something about this game just feels really satisfying to play and every time i touch it, I was met with an incredibly pleasant experience (even though i die and fail a lot).  * Although, for complete beginners, the game is really easy to drop when you first touch it (I know since I dropped it when i first got the game) since you're not entirely sure what to expect, but take your time to learn the basics and do some wiki lurking here and there when you're stuck and you'd find that the game goes much deeper and offers an incredibly rich experience than you'd first expected (I know it did for me).   [The Game] * Game flow fundamentally revolves around defeating bosses. You make preparations for boss battles which when defeated, unlocks more options for you to play around with to prepare for the next boss you set your sight on, progressively making you stronger but also changing the world around you, introducing something new with each boss defeated whether that be new equipment, or entirely new areas of the world.  * Often times defeating a boss once won't give you everything you want, so you will occasionally find yourself killing a boss twice or thrice. Although, if you prefer, you can do them only once and move on which would be as equally viable as slapping them over and over until you have everything they can possibly drop for you (although it might be bad for the bosses' own mental health).   [The Experience] * Terraria doesn't particularly demand you to play it in any specific way. You can play it in any way you prefer and at the pacing you wish to play in. It gives you a goal and challenges you but doesn't confine you to just a single exit, instead it gives you hundreds of tools to play and tinker around with in how you approach the obstacles the game presented to you.  * The amount of diversity in the way you can progress and complete this game in is outstanding. My experience in the game didn't feel predictable nor repetitive despite the game having clear checkpoints (the bosses) and a limited world (literally just an island). Despite always having the same biomes guaranteed to spawn in a world, each experience feel new and being acquainted with them does not make the experience bland but instead enriching it since the way you interact with your environment matters, making me feel rewarded the more I know and understand.  * It also helps that all content in the game whether it be building, mining, farming, exploring or just good old murder of local wildlife weaves back into the core game progression seamlessly without ever feeling out of place, making it easy to get immersed with the game. Thanks to this it does not confine you to any kind of play style, you may progress through the game however you want to, but it also does not discourage or punish you for straying off from the core progression.   [Conclusion] * Its a good game, give it a chance and take your time getting used to it. Don't shy away from the wiki if you feel like you're really stuck or unsure what to do next. If you're not feeling like a hardcore masochist the game also offers a much more relaxed experience through Journey mode characters so try that if you're a really casual player. Fine tune the experience to the experience you're looking for and you'll find yourself in an incredibly pleasant experience (that also involves a lot of dying, but you'll get used to it)   So basically, What i want to say is, this game is fun and i love it I recommend it if you're bored I spent 2 hours writing this Its 3 AM How'd this happen",774.6,Recommended,"388 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-11-28 00:00:00,"This is most likely the only review I will ever do for a game, and I believe that the grounds of my review are legitimate. I have played this game for just under 600 hours (Online) and countless more offline, as well as playing it on my friends account for many more hours. 6 years ago, I asked my cousin if I could buy a game. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. It was dirt cheap, 10 US dollars at the time, which is a crime considering how much love and passion has gone into this game, as well as the many sleepless nights it has provided me and many other fans. Waiting for it to download, I was ecstatic. The art style was cool and retro, and the gameplay trailers promised a land filled with enemies and abandoned temples that had succumbed to time, ripe for the picking. Many biomes to traverse and even some hidden gems scattered across the world. I couldn’t wait to get my grubby little hands on it. From the moment I booted up the game, the music and visuals instantly invigorated me. It felt so cool to create your own character, so many different styles and colours, so many choices and personalization’s you could do. I spent around 5 minutes creating my first character, and after that, I was set out into a mysterious world, filled with giant worms and flying spit bugs that would decapitate me at a moments notice. My first night is one I will never forget. Armed with shuriken’s from a nearby cave and stranded on a hill, I had no choice but to fight off the hordes of undead. They were coming at me from every direction, and with demon eyes flying overhead, death was inevitable.  As soon as I respawned, my gut instinct was to protect the guide because he had no home to hunker down in. Eventually, we held off the masses and dawn finally came. I had realized that I needed a house to stay in, and that’s when I had discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of any games I have played; the building.  There are so sososososososo many blocks to build, hammer and axe together in intuitive, creative and interesting ways. The early days were not the best for building, as the textures were quite pixelated and low quality. But the quality of the builds had gotten exponentially better. The community came up with so many unique and downright amazing builds, and it only got better with each update. There was sloping blocks, paint, different walls, how each block melded together, how each block interacted with other blocks, the light sources, the different platforms that you could use. All this and more meant that anything that you could think of you could build. This game was one of the best imaginative and creative masterpieces that has ever graced the steam platform.  After I was done building my house, I set out to find more loot to plunder. That’s when I realised that this games combat is executed flawlessly. Normal mode was a bit too easy for me, so the combat was less punishing then I’d like it to be, but the devs heard about this and introduced both expert and master mode in later updates providing a perfect balance between satisfying combat and the risk taking nature of the skirmishes that took place within the different biomes. Everything about the combat is satisfying, even hitting a slime with a simple copper short sword or an axe is satisfying. And it only got better from there. The progression is done immaculately, precariously positioning the player on a tight rope of equipment and weapons while also drunkenly swinging at the player from every which way, you have to be on your toes at all time. Just when you think you’ve become a god at the game with wearing molten lava and swinging a sword made of fire, the game punches you in the gut and curb stomps you. And you cannot wait to get back into it.  The gameplay loop is a satisfying composition of combat, farming and building. Everything that you do in this game contributes towards progress. Building houses? More NPC’s to trade with. Want herbs? You got potions to buff you with. Fishing? Boom, rare items that could (RIP Reaver shark) catapult your progress into the future, skipping entire phases of the game. Speaking of phases of the game, it has some of the best and most satisfying transitions in between gameplay elements. Every bit of progress that you make feels infinitely more satisfying than the last, and it keeps pushing you forward, to the point of not stopping. I remember trying to farm for a rare item (Turtle Shells) for 14 hours straight, and I only got 1. I did other stuff in between, sure, but the game keeps you hooked in between objectives and allows for some breathing room in between bosses. As well as being incredibly challenging and rewarding, it is peaceful at times.  With the Journeys end update, the new music added a whole new layer immersion. I could spend hours flying a kite on a rooftop, listening to the songs and watching my NPC’s just walk around and chat. There is so much to do in this game, its not just combat oriented. And all of this is just in single player! The game has so much support for its community, from steam support and mods all the way up to the wiki and forums that the devs occasionally scour. It is a fantastic game, and I could not recommend it more.  I absolutely adore this game, and it has been a vent for my creativity and inspiration over the years. My words could never do it justice, even though I hope to describe even a fraction of what this game has been to me.  Thanks for reading 😊",894.4,Recommended,"349 people found this review helpful

105600,2019-06-17 00:00:00,"Terraria is one of the top rated games on steam. And honestly, it deserves it. I think this is a damn good game. I won’t say it’s a perfect game and there are certainly some things you should know before you buy it, but I will happily give it a recommend.  Let Me Begin with What the Game is About and What Makes it Cool. You start out with a basic sword, axe, and pickaxe, in the middle of nowhere. You’re first step is to get wood and build a shelter to protect you from the zombies at night. Next you need to dig down and get ore to make better gear. So it’s 2d minecraft? Well it’s more than that, let me continue. You’ll need decent armor and weapons to fight the tougher monsters that live underground and to fight bosses.  Yep bosses. Bosses are one of the defining elements of this game. Bosses are big and imposing and they play this awesome adrenaline music when you summon them (a lot of the Terraria music is awesome btw). And there’s a huge variety of bosses too: There’s a floating eye that aggressively charges at you, there’s a big worm creature that breaks into smaller worms as you damage it, there’s an angry plant that can only be fought in the claustrophobic jungle, there’s a cult leader that summons mirages of itself and makes the game into a bullet hell with how many projectiles it spits out. Now bosses can be very punishing, but this is a building/crafting game, so you can build your own arena with platforms to jump on and walls to protect you from (some) attacks, or craft potions that boost your speed, health regen, armor, and damage. The fact that you can tackle bosses on your own terms in your own arena is one of the most interesting parts of the game and it really makes boss fights feel epic.  Killing bosses is the main way you progress through the game. Killing them gives you some kickass loot or lets you access a parts of the world where you can discover some more kickass loot. There’s a lot of loot in this game. And it’s some pretty cool loot too. You get staffs that call meteors down from the sky, fireball staffs, swords that shoot fireballs, machine guns, rocket launchers, different kinds of ammo to go in your guns, yo-yo’s (yo-yos are a really cool weapon), boomerangs, tools that summon monsters or turrets to fight for you, tools that let you jump real high (useful for dodging boss attacks), vehicles that let you move real fast, grappling hooks for going spelunking. The more bosses you kill and the further you progress, the more powerful and interesting the loot you get. Seriously, getting new loot just feels absolutely wonderful in this game.  So yeah, I would say mining, boss fighting, and collecting loot are the meat of the game, but there’s plenty of gravy too. Maybe you want to take a break from boss fighting and do some fishing so you can get a chainsaw fish and also some potion ingredients. Well then you probably want to create a few ponds throughout your world. And you’ll probably want to set up some minecart tracks or teleporters to get to your ponds quickly. Or maybe you want to set up a mushroom farm because mushroom are good for potions as well as crafting some late game armor. Well you’ll want to create several rows of dirt so the mushrooms have plenty of surface area to spawn on. And if you don’t want to harvest mushrooms manually you can set up a bunch of conveyor belts and wire so the mushrooms just fall down and come to you. Or maybe a part of your world is corrupt. Corruption spreads slowly so you may want to dig a trench around it to keep it quarantined, or you can buy a special gun that cleanses corruption outright. Or maybe you need a bunch of unicorn horns. You could go to the part of the world where unicorns spawn and kill them with your flaming yo-yo. Or you could dig a big pit and every time a unicorn come by it falls into the pit and dies because the pit is full of lava and spiky traps. This is a crafting game where enemies are just another crafting resource, so setting up a death pit to farm unicorns is a logical thing to do. There’s plenty of stuff to do in Terraria and plenty of ways to do it.   First of all, the difficulty. Specifically, the bosses. Bosses will kill you. Bosses are tough. You can give yourself boosts with potions and armor, but dodging attacks is your best bet. And that can be very difficult when the boss charges rapidly at you or shoots a dozen balls of lightning at you. You will need to learn the attack patterns of bosses and you will need to train your reflexes. I mentioned bullet hell earlier, and I really do think this game has bullet hell elements. If you just can’t stand bullet hell games you probably want to avoid Terraria. (Since difficulty is a pretty subjective thing, you may want to look up a video review of Terraria and see some boss fights and combat for yourself.)  Another thing I want to mention is the sheer amount of stuff to learn. You should be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Terraria wiki. It’s a crafting game, so you’ll need to look up crafting recipes as well as how to get ingredients. It’s also a game about fighting giant bosses, so you’ll need to know how to summon bosses and you’ll probably want to read some tips on making an arena. If you want to build a garden or fishing pond you’ll want to know when certain herbs bloom and how much water to put in your pond. For building more complex structures, you may want to look up tutorials on youtube (the game has gone through several updates though, so some youtube tutorials are out of date). Personally, I kinda enjoyed learning the game. I’d get some weird item in my inventory and immediately going to the wiki to see what I could do with it. But I realize not everyone wants to study a wiki while they play video games.  One of the interesting parts of the game is how it’s a building/fighting hybrid kind of game. And while that’s cool some of the time, it can be really annoying at other times. Say you’re underground building an arena to fight a boss, then a bat flies out at you, now you have to stop building and take out your weapon. So you kill the bat and try to get back to building, but another bat spawns and you have to kill that one too. The game literally has a formula where if it detects there aren’t any enemies near you it will spawn new enemies, so you will constantly have to fight off annoying enemies while you’re trying to build or mine. (I should mention that there are tools that help deal with enemy harassment, but you need to know how to get them, which reinforces my point that you need to read the wiki)  I don’t really like Terraria’s endgame. Most of the early and midgame consists of exploring, building, and crafting, with the occasional action-packed boss fight thrown in, which I like because it offers some nice variety. However the endgame is back-to-back combat. Fight a boss, then fight a bunch of minibosses, then fight another boss, then fight four living towers which spawn very fast very dangerous enemies, then fight another boss. For my first playthrough of this game I stopped playing when I got to the endgame because I just didn’t want to slog through all the fighting. Now, I actually like the combat and I liked fighting bosses throughout the game, but it’s a simple combat system and fighting loses some of its charm when you do it for too long.  So this review turned out longer than I expected. I guess I wanted to be thorough. When I first played this game I got pretty frustrated at times and I was prepared to toss out the game altogether. But then I got into it a bit more and learned the mechanics better and I actually really liked it. Despite its flaws, this is probably one of my favorite games ever.",113.5,Recommended,"372 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-12-28 00:00:00,"Most likely, my review will remain in the shadows, and hardly anyone will reach the end of my review, I still want to share with you my feelings and the seasoned spirit of adventure. It all started many years ago, when I got acquainted with one of the most wonderful, warm, and memorable games in my life - Terraria. When pronouncing this word, I immediately feel warm in my soul, I remember the wonderful soundtrack and completely immerse myself in my thoughts. Before reviewing, I immediately want to note that this game gave me a new perception of computer games, and gave me a great childhood.  I myself am not an ordinary player in Terraria, and there are few such oldies, because I got acquainted with Terraria even before its release, or more precisely, before the official release of the game on Steam (May 16, 2011). And although I have played 200 hours of this game in my Steam, I actually played it for about 1000 hours. When I was little, I, like all children, played Minecraft, and I really liked this game, I thought that I could not find a better game. But one fine day, my dad came home from work and told me about Terraria, which just appeared. Another employee told Dad about the game, and another employee told this employee, and then I don't know the story of the spread of rumors about a brand new freshly baked Terraria. When I first started the game, I created my character, spending several hours on it, pressed the button to create a world, and found myself on the ground. Someone walked next to me, his name was Guide, who first fell into the abyss ... I don't know why he did it, but it didn't really bother me. The first thing I learned was how to walk, jump and dig, and it was incredibly fun! After that I dug a hole for myself, buried myself on top and went to play Minecraft ... Don't judge strictly, but for a child then Minecraft was much more colorful, and had a 3D view, and not a cropped 3D space along the Z axis. But a couple of days later I went back in into the game, and again continued to explore the world, the game did not cause as much enthusiasm for me as many people who have started playing quite recently. And I don't know if it's good that I started playing such a raw game. But as time went on, I studied the world of Terraria more and more. I got to know cute teardrop-mongers and creatures that were constantly killing me. I realized that I needed a home to live, and that's when I discovered one of the best aspects of not only this game, but one of the best aspects of all the games I've played - building. So I gave up traveling and started BUILDING and DIGGING! And then this game completely sucked me in. I quit Minecraft and started DIGGING, KILLING, AND EXPLORING. I met new residents who can SELL! And a nurse who can CHOOSE! I also realized that the Guide is not a useless piece of garbage, and that you can have a heart-to-heart talk with him. In the end, I killed the ominous Eye of Cthulhu, which sowed fear, and the game ended there ... But soon new updates came out, I downloaded new versions and went all over again. And it was interesting. I went through each update, and did not get a mental pleasure. Since I like everything more difficult, I started playing the game on the Expert Advisor, and later on the Master. But all this was not enough for me! And I started to go through mods, for those who know Calamity mod, I went through this game with Revenge and Death modes, and also after a few hundred attempts I went through Boss Rush. Then I lost my nerves.  With each update, the game brought new emotions and a colorful world to the players and me. Every progress you make is much more satisfying than the last one and continues to push you forward, to the point where you don't stop. There is no point in talking about old versions, so I'll tell you a couple (hundreds) of words about the new Terraria.  For me this game became a home in which I felt comfortable. The game is currently in the game about 500 varieties of mobs. There are also 19 bosses and 13 mini-bosses, as well as 3 additional bosses in the mobile version. And from listing recipes you can break your tongue. Sloped blocks, paints, different walls were added to the game, each block merged together, each block interacted with other blocks. Light sources, different platforms that you may have used. All of this and more meant that anything imaginable could be built. Many people create amazing mechanisms and worlds, better than on paper!) Although they made a convenient interface for creating my character in the game, I also devote a lot of time to creating a character). And the music and style of play makes me crazy. I bought this game for my every account, and made all my friends, no matter if it was voluntary, to purchase this masterpiece. And if you are thinking whether to buy this game, I can hardly answer you ... YES !!! This game is amazing both solo and when playing with friends! You can catch hares and then fill the whole world of your friend with them! It's worth buying for this!  I can confidently say that Terraria has become my corner of safety, this is my home, there is no place easier and quieter than it.

105600,2020-10-03 00:00:00,"💻/📱 Description: Terraria is among the BEST if not the best game of this decade, which surprises me considering its very low price. The content is beyond overwhelming with many bosses, challenges and options that you won’t ever get bored of. The game revolves around you the player, as the difficulty and gameplay change depending upon your progression. The art style and music are very exceptional, bringing us the fanbase pleasant memories even to this day.  📖 Setting: Summary Terraria is a land full of mystery and wonder. You the adventure are given the task to cleanse this magical world from the spreading cancer called Hollow/Corruption. Many powerful beings will stand in your way, so grab some loot, find allies and restore the balance. Since many players forget the fact that Terraria includes a story in the first place. I suggest you read the lore from the to get accustomed to the plot.  Terraria refers to casual and hardcore players alike. You can slay forces or start creating buildings, without though being obliged to do so. The game offers a variety of blocks and items that encourage creativity. You can even build your mini-golf park! The goal here is to have fun and not just constantly grind for loot.  The actual Difficulty mode is a character set selected during character creation. There are 5 types of difficulty: Softcore, Mediumcore, Hardcore and the newly added mode that can only be played on journey worlds. All the above-mentioned modes change the penalty upon death.   Another form of difficulty is Those are separate settings that apply to the rather than the Players may choose between Journey, Classic, Expert, and Master mode when creating a new seed. Each mode provides more loot, as well as special accessories depending on the difficulty you have chosen. I advise players to start with the Classic mode, as Expert and Master are very demanding for a novice adventurer.  Terraria starts its gameplay slow and steady, as it should be. You begin your journey with only 3 tools (sword, axe, pickaxe) at your disposal and a companion useful for his crafting guides. It’s up to the player whether you want to challenge the game since your imagination, skill and creativity shape the word and thus the adventure. As a tip, I suggest you start building a small house in the beginning.  Terraria forces the player to manipulate the environment to survive. You can chop trees used for crafting; mine rocks used for building or combine all the materials to cross large gaps etc. Physics plays a major role in the game’s playstyle, so do expect lots of deaths caused by There is also a small detail concerning nightfall, but that’s a surprise for you to explore.   Terraria is very famous for its grinding potential. There are many repeatable bosses, each offering different and unique that are considered valuable for your future encounters. Countless items offered by a specific boss or gained by certain activities, such as fishing, have a very low . This concept favours repeatability, so do be patient, as sometimes even the best things in life take a while.   There are 4 classes in Terraria: Magic, Ranged, Melee and Summoning. Each class requires different armour sets and weapons that provide unique stats and abilities, depending upon the material they were made from. It is most favourable to stick with 1 class during a playthrough, as this way you can aim your focus on specific items and equipment. Read the and choose carefully which role to main first.   There are lots of accessories, mounts as well as vanity items with interesting that bring joy to competitive and creative players alike. A perfect example is the which grants the user the ability to extra-jump midair. You can combine the accessories to create even stronger ones in the Tinkerer's Workshop. There are countless combinations, so take your time while reading the  Overall, the experience is amazing, however, the learning curve is extremely demanding. This is a feature that does not go well with many players. As you have noticed above, you have to consult the regularly to truly master the game. Otherwise, you going to encounter many problems and difficulties that eventually will lead to confusion. Terraria is grind demanding game, so bring some friends in your journeys as co-op is more than encouraging!  Terraria runs pretty well even on a Pc. It is a small game with a gorgeous yet simple artstyle that continues to captivate me to this day. The game runs smoothly in low settings with minor loading times. In the rare case you encounter problems with performance, I suggest you turn off the effects.  Terraria’s music is in its way. Every biome, boss as well as event has its unique song that fits the theme. I encourage you to buy as it proves to be a piece of excellent background music to listen to. You also provide a small token of appreciation to the developers.  Terraria is a challenging game for those who want to reach its completion. Before starting your adventure, I recommend you to get accustomed to terms like Pre-Hardmode - Hardmode mode etc. The game takes time to master, so do not get disappointed if you are struggling in the beginning. Be patient and most importantly have fun.  If you crave more challenges the (available on Steam) will become your best friend, so why don’t you give it a try!!  The below links are some content creators that gonna make you fall in love with the journey. They provide tips as well as tricks that prove very useful having them at your disposal :  •   •   •   Having in mind its low price compared to the amount of content that it offers, I consider Terraria a gaming paradise for both creative and challenge thirsty players. It refers to all ages, as its unique gameplay encourages fun and creativity. You can build constructions, kill enemies, fight bosses, everything depends upon your playstyle. We are stealing a church!  I need to express my enormous gratitude to Re-Logic, as their sheer will and passion made this masterpiece relevant, with many updates and tweaks beloved by the community.",274.0,Recommended,"396 people found this review helpful

Once you've made your character, you start off in the world of Terraria. Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?  If you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.  Beware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.  In your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.  Tunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy.

105600,2020-06-06 00:00:00,"Terraria is a game I recommend everyone to own on Steam. It consistantly goes on sale for $2.50, and this game offers dozens of hours of solid entertainment.  To be completely honest, for years I did not like Terraria. The biggest problem with the game is you literally don't know what to do or how to progress in the game without looking up a guide on the Terraria Wiki, or by asking more experienced players. To me, I just find that as bad game design. There could have been some sort of quest log that gave you some indication of what to do next, otherwise the beginning of the game becomes rather dull.  Moving on, once you do know what you are doing, the game becomes surprisingly more enjoyable as Terraria focuses on combat and boss encounters. Each boss is different from one another, and are actually challenging. The game limits you from getting better gear until a specific boss is defeated which keeps the challenge high throughout.  Apart from that, as you kill bosses new enemies and events will appear in the game unlocking a vast new variety of weapons, items, and equipment.  One thing I had not realized is the incredible amount of content Terraria offers. As soon as you think you are done with the game, it just keeps going with even more bosses, more grind for even better gear, and just so much new stuff as you go along. (be sure to keep checking the wiki to see what bosses are next and how to unlock them)      General overview: + Loads of content + Fun combat system with a large variety of weapons, spells, and gear. + Lots of fantastic bosses + Very challenging + An ever-changing world with loads to explore + Great fun with friends + Very easy to host a server and game is very minimal on resources (meaning anyone with a PC can enjoy this, even on a laptop)  - Somewhat impossible to progress without a guide - The first half of the game is rather boring compared to the later half - A bit straining on the eyes with pixel graphics, especially with a high resolution monitor - A bit too challenging at times (especially playing solo) - Resources are limited, meaning you won't be able to get items without generating a new world (your character can move between worlds and servers)   To sum things up, Terraria is a fantastic game to play with at least one friend (preferably just 2-4 ). It offers an extremely high amount of content, lots of bosses, fun gameplay, lots to explore and craft, and its cheap!  +++ Highly recommend.",216.9,Recommended,"483 people found this review helpful

105600,2023-12-25 00:00:00,"... should probably write a review for this game at some point.  Here's how I'd summarize Terraria: Your goal is to make a super powerful character that destroys all the boss monsters. And then you destroy those boss monsters. Along the way, you go exploring, mining, build some 2D houses, explore *a* dungeon or two, farm a bunch of mob loot... Oh, and just for fun, there's also fishing, golfing, logic circuits, dress-up, a thousand decorative items for building, ...  When getting new people into this game, I noted these common issues: You rarely know what to do next. The onboarding *exists*, the hints are *there*, but it's not enough to replace a wiki. While the spritework is nice, the small scale of everything holds it back. Various details in tiles and character cosmetics are too small to really appreciate, which can make the look of the game unappealing to some people. (Though if you're already looking at this review, you probably won't mind that as much.) The game's ""two phases"" appeal to different people. Early game is slow, with slow exploration, awkward attacks, and a bunch of ""hold left click for 10 minutes"" moments. Late game is fast-paced, challenging, and almost rushes by. If you're ONLY into one of these two, you may have trouble dealing with the other. The small scale, coupled with the fast pace of combat in the lategame, lead to some visibility problems. Aiming at enemies that are off-screen is a somewhat common occurrence in this game.  My recommendation for your first playthrough:        This game's great. Not for everyone, but I still get obsessed with it every now and then. One should not wish for sequels, but if this game ever got one, I'd have high hopes for it. The mods are also great. Lots of cool content to explore there, if you're ever craving for more. Give it a try. It's dirt cheap for what it is.","2,100.7",Recommended,"237 people found this review helpful

105600,2019-04-26 00:00:00,"Let's start the review with the obvious: go buy this game. Now, let's get to the review: Everybody (that doesn't play Terraria) says that this game is 2D Minecraft. Well, they're wrong. Terraria is like Minecraft but better in any way. Exploring feels like it should be: quick, simple and rewarding and the arsenal of tools like pickaxes, drills, ropes and torches makes that even more enjoyable. The environment is full of chests and vases that reward you just for walking around. You can also found Heart Crystals that boost your Max HP and Fallen Stars that boost your Max Mana. Combat feels clumsy at the beggining, but the more you play, the better it will get. The combat turns from a Copper Sword Stabby-Stab to Missiles, Bursts of Energy, Homing Bullets, Falling Meteorites, Massive Swords. Mining is as it should be: quick! You can spend only 5min just mining a rare ore, where in Minecraft, you will spend hours to find Diamonds and it depends on layers, stripminings, caverns, etc. In Terraria, you have things to help you find ore more easily, such as better tools, Pets that give you light, torches that highlight treasures, potions that show you where the treasures is, equipables that describe your surroundings, bombs/tnt that, for sure, help you get rid of the terrain and you don't feel that you've wasted your materials spending them. The Progression in this game is top notch. In the beggining you can't even beat a blob, but as soon as you grab some armor you can beat it easily. It's fun to discover that you're still too weak to walk to other biomes like the desert and jungle. And after you get comfortable with the gameplay, when you can beat every mob in the world, the game has the BALLS to strip that liberty away and put you in Noob Phase again. The switch between Pre-Hardmode and Hardmode is a huge step for gaming. It strips your sense of greatness without striping you off your items. The world, your map change with the flow of the game, new ores appear, the ore changes between worlds, so it is never the same, new mobs appear, corrupted biomes spread to other biomes, and if you don't pay attention, it will, eventually, take over the whole map. Even if you had explored the map previously, you will still explore the same areas because new ore, loot and enemies will appear. It never gets old being killed by Unicorns and Pixie Fairies. This is the first game where I do like brewing my potions, in Minecraft that function feels useless, either you don't use it at all, or you only use it for boss fights or breathing underwater. In Terraria you use them for everything. You use potions for Scaveging, Danger Hunting, Boss Fighting, Teleporting, Flying, Water Walking... It feels good using potions, and you don't feel cheated when you use them. Fishing is under appreciated. This mechanic is way better than Minecraft's or Stardew Valley's. You are not obligated to do it, but it will reward you with ore, vanity items, furniture, money, very good equipables, rods, bait, fish (that can be used for potions). It can be boring at times, but you don't even have to be alert, it functions with a simple mouse click. Building is god-like, you can build everything, you have all kinds of furniture, you can mold blocks with your hammer, and you can even paint all blocks in the game or create your custom biomes with paint. Even if you are bad at building and you'd like to build great things (like me) you can easily copy any screenshot of any building you see browsing the web. The houses you building will all feel comfortable. Wiring is like Minecraft's Redstone, but more simpler (sometimes). Wiring gives you the opportunity to build traps, build farms and teleport yourself around the map (yes, TELEPORT). Wiring also gives you motives to be careful when exploring caves because there might be traps lurking. Even if you play alone, your world feels alive, everywhere you go you have something. Wanna go left/right? You have Desert, Tundra, Jungle, Beaches, Meteorite, Hallow, Corruption/Crimson. Wanna go up? You have Sky Islands and Sky Lakes. Wanna go down? You have Granite, Marble, Spider-Nests, Mushroom Biomes, and even Hell (Underworld). The world isn't infinite like in Minecraft (I know it isn't infinite, but c'mon) but it still feels huge, and it even will change overtime with your adventure. Terraria will still offer you options like Pets, Light Pets, Mounts, Minecarts, Grappling Hooks and even Wings that you can collect if you feel like getting all the items. Even with all of this variety Terraria will offer events like Blood Moon, Solar Eclipse, etc which will give you another look at more new mobs, even more loot and even more fun. Some of the events change over time too, and offer great loot. And the bosses? Omg, the bosses are amazing. When you play, you're always thinking of when the new one's gonna come out. You'll get addicted to beat bosses, and Terraria has a fair share of bosses. In the beggining they feels kinda weak and easy, but it will change over time too. Bosses have themes behind them, Queen Bee is in the Jungle, Eater of Worlds is in the Corruption, Moon Lord appears after you defeat the Lunar Events, etc. Ah, and it even has multiple classes, and each and every one of them feels rewarding to play. Every one of them is fun to play, and the game doesn't force you to choose one of them at the beggining of the game, giving you time to experiment each class during your playtime. NPC's, in Terraria are very good and distinguished from each other. They don't look alike and don't ""NAH"" ""OH"" around. Each have their own personality and each one of them serves a purpose and gives life to your world, you will never feel alone. After all of this, you get another difficulty, which increases the difficulty (ofc), but increases the drop quality and it even gives you Expert only items that are worth the difficulty just for the items alone. The game feels rewarding and delivers in everything that is shown, and it is still being updated. This game is not grindy, you will only have to grind for specific items that are not required. And even with all of that, you still have mods. I have not experienced them, but everybody , in the Terraria community, knows that mods are god like. Mods like Calamity and Thorium are a must. And the Soundtrack is very good. Each biome has it's own theme, and it's very recognizable. You can tell the day/night cycle just by listening, or the biome you're in and the transitions between biomes are very well made. The bosses have their own themes too, but I'm always too busy fighting them so I don't even have the chance to listen. I've played so many games and I have NEVER seen a community like Terraria's. Everyone is so helpful, and the Youtubers are so memorable, from Happydays to Python and Grobeman. So, after reading my review, and looking at the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews for this game, what's your excuse for not buying? It's the best time to buy this game, it will get another update soon full with new stuff.

It is simplistic enough to jump right into and yet at the same time, complex enough to keep one playing for years and years. The three pillars of the game are Building, Fighting, and Exploring. You have your own little (or not so little) world that is chock full of loot enemies and unique environments for you to kill and build yourself while doing the same to your planet. Good enemies: as varied as the freckle patterns on a persons face fun loot: There are six buttloads of stuff to shoot, slash, equip, or throw. (or explode) Blocks: for the crafty, theres a bunch of different blocks... (like if you though minecraft had a lot of blocks...) Bosses: you keep thinking how am I ever gonna be strong enough to beat that. (then you get strong enough and theres another)  all in all I highly recommend this game. its awesome. 10/10 would (will) definitely play again","3,297.3",Recommended,"227 people found this review helpful

I remember looking up what Steam was and having to convince my parents it was a trustworthy platform, and for a very low price tag that to this day is honestly a steal for how much content this game has. 1k hours later and I'm still having a blast with the newest update, the devs have put so much time and care into this game it's very admirable.  What sticks out the strongest to me though is how great character progression feels in this game. It's able to balance feeling like you're constantly growing more powerful without ever feeling overpowered, as one boss always leads into the next. Pack that in with the insane amount of content packed into one game and it's something I'll be returning to time and again for years to come.","1,216.7",Recommended,"250 people found this review helpful

105600,2014-10-25 00:00:00,"3/22/2023 - This is one of my oldest reviews that uses my outdated format, I no longer make use of this format.  Introduction I am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you. If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.  UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as ""Expert Mode"" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners).  How I Found Out About ""Terraria"" I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called ""Terraria"". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it.  When ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear ""Minecraft clone"" or ""2D Minecraft"". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft.  Terraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before.  Terraria is a , , , etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one and has  Example on the kind of enemies you could come across. Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the or . As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.  ""Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?"" Good question. Let's get that.  This is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single and still have many things to do.  In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience.  Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding underground.  The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.  I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes.  Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience.  Pro's: +Loads of content for hours of game time. +Great combat system. +Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into. +Provides a good challenge. +Fun and creative boss battles. +Amazing side events that you cannot resist. +Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters. +Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.  Con's: -No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)  Overall Rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)  Thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.  Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.","1,922.8",Recommended,"1,822 people found this review helpful

105600,2017-11-28 00:00:00,"First and foremost, this is an ""adventure"" game. No, not an ""adventure game."" In those you pick up a stick shaped like an ""F"" and use it to open an oversized lock on a chest full of bubblegum that you'll soon need to throw at some dogs so you can sneak past them to get to the... no. This is an ""adventure"" game. The game is an adventure.  A real adventure. Like when you take a shortcut through the wilderness, but end up further and further off path as you follow a stream, looking for a good place to cross.  A real adventure. Like when you go hiking in the mountains and get lost. Only to realize it'll be quicker to get back to civilization by continuing forward, rather than returning the way you came.  A real adventure. Like when you find yourself some place you've never been before, and with just a few tools, build yourself a makeshift home and defend it from zombies at night while exploring the world around you during the day. Eventually working your way underground into chasms filled with treasure and the occasional abandoned dwelling. Perhaps running across a giant beehive in an underground jungle or a buried pyramid under the desert. Finding your way deep into the darkness where the dead wander freely and mushrooms fluoresce brightly. Going deeper and deeper yet; to the point where the molten core of the planet lights up your eyes in a way only the sun had previously done.  The hard part of writing a review for a game like this is not spoiling too much while still letting people know how deep the game actually is. So much of what I enjoyed about my first playthrough of this game was . Terraria might seem too simple when you first start out, and then possibly even overwhelming. But you'll be glad you spent effort to follow the stream or continue forward through the mountains.  There's weapons and magic, but you never pick a class, like warrior or archer. Due to the wide range of weapons, accessories, and armor choices you'll suddenly realize at some point, perhaps when surrounded by your minions, that you've specialized as a summoner. Or that you're a wizard, or explosives expert. Or perhaps you're some unique archer-warrior hybrid. But your choices and discoveries have slowly lead you into your role; you never chose it from a drop down list.  There's a multitude of biomes to discover. Each with their own unique enemies, and of course, epic boss fights. There's an incredible number of things you can do as you progress through the game. And while it plays fine single player, if you have a friend or two you can bring with you on this journey, you'll have that much more fun and they will thank you for it.  Sure, you can spend hours upon hours building elaborate castles decorated with furniture you've crafted or statues you've collected from around the world. You can reshape the terrain around you - spreading biomes you like or cutting down those you don't. You can even bring biomes up from deep in the earth and set up the perfect potion mushroom farm right next to your base. One of my favorite things to do is to use the wiring system to set elaborate boobie traps around my fortifications. But you don't have to do of that to progress. It's really all up to you. Although even if none of that is ""your thing,"" you might be so drawn in that you find yourself happily engaged in such activities.  And yes, a big part of the game is digging, but it's primarily a means of exploration. A means of reaching that next treasure chest, or cluster of gems. A means of reaching the next deep fissure in the earth. A great adventure awaits you.",273.1,Recommended,"321 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-09-21 00:00:00,"When I first bought into Terraria, I was expecting 2D Minecraft. On the surface, that is essentially what it is, with buildings being done in 16-bit rather than a blocky visual style. However, the comparison to Minecraft ends at the construction element, as there is so much more to experience.  Firstly, it looks gorgeous. This is 16-bit done very right, with sprites being well-defined and the world fitting together near-seamlessly.  The combat is an area which could have been half-arsed, but wasn't. Initially, the variety is nothing to write home about, but it quickly expands to several weapons, from ranged to melee to magic and sometimes a combination of the three. Combine this with armour pieces, accessories, set bonuses and a crafting system where weapons can be combined to make new weapons (depending on recipes, mind), and you're left with an in-depth system for tooling yourself out with a myriad pieces of equipment. There's several boss fights too, whose defeat are pivotal to progression.  While the worlds the game makes aren't infinite, they are all quite different from each other and you can save several of them at once, and you can visit any of them with a single persistent character, encouraging multiple worlds to find everything you need in terms of resources.  NPCs are an important part of Terraria as they sell certain items which can't be acquired otherwise. In order to attract them, you need to build them a home, which ties into the construction aspect of the game rather well. You can make a lavish palace, a two storey flat or anything above or in between. The only limit to your creativity is the map limit, which is quite vast and allows space for many personal creations.  I could go on gushing about Terraria, how it continues to be interesting regardless of what you're doing, how after killing all the bosses Hard Mode is unlocked, which populates the world with new tougher critters, and so on. Bottom line is, you owe it to yourself to play Terraria.",105.9,Recommended,"250 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-06-26 00:00:00,"I would like to start off this review by saying one thing. This is one of the best games ever made. Now, most people would probably look at this game and think it's just 2D Minecraft, but it is so much more than that. The main similarities are in the blocks and survival aspects of it. But beyond that Terraria is just so much more.  Summary:  Gameplay - [9] When you start a world for the first time it is a very slow game, but the game quickly picks up the pace. There is no hand-holding in this game whatsoever, you have to do everything yourself or check the Terraria wiki page. You change a lot during your adventure and in the end the game is very fast-paced.  Soundtrack - [10] The soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard in a sandbox game. It's so simplistic yet so good. It is very catchy and I will never forget the iconic song Overworld Day which is instantly recognized.  Graphics - [10] Since it isn't aiming for realistic graphics you really cannot give it a bad score. It's a very specific kind of art style that fits the game very well.  Price - [10] The price is incredibly cheap compared to what you get. You get a really long game with a bunch of replay value. It costs 9,99€ on Steam but often goes down to 4.99€ during sales. It's a great price.  In conclusion: Terraria is a fantastic game that has everything you would ever want in a game like this. You should really buy this if you want a really good sandbox game. The developers have been supporting this game for years now and still have 1 last update left called Journey's End.

105600,2018-08-05 00:00:00,"I’d only wish I had played this game sooner!  Terraria is a fascinating game, that introduces players to an open, 2D world that features adventure, building, crafting, boss battles and much more. As a player who had experienced the vanilla and the mod variant, I’ll be commenting for both game experiences.  The vanilla [original] game present you with the basic components of how to play. While it can be a grind at the start to gather materials to build, in the later game you’ll be introduced to more content, new areas, enemies and NPCs. The game is hugely focused on progression, which makes it quite an addiction to play. My favorite aspects of the game are the weapons and gear, plus the boss battles. No item is ever the same, as well as the monsters that we face. The aesthetics are also nice; the Plantera mask and kimono were one of my personal favorites to dress for my character. Lots of items in the game are customizable, including colour changes to upgrades for bonus stats.  Now, for the mod version, there were even more available content for players. The mods my friends and I played with on his server were namely the Thorium Mod and Calamity mod. These mods added features such as more boss monsters, items, NPC and more. Some players will frown at mods and call it “cheats” and whatnot. However, this is not the case as it brings more complexity to the original game, and it's not intended for new players anyways. We played on Expert/Revengeance mode and fought additional bosses like Astrium Deus, and the Siren and Leviathan. In my experience, the modded variation provided and even more thrilling challenge than the Vanilla version. I recommend trying it after you’ve completed the original game.  In general, Terraria is a must-play for anyone who hasn’t done so.",91.2,Recommended,"213 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-03-09 00:00:00,"Humanity is responsible for some of the worst atrocities imaginable. Genocide, war, slavery, those complete degenerates who shove gum on the underside of tables. But there are some things humans have accomplished that just completely balance out the bad ♥♥♥♥ that they do. We have constructed flying machines, built gigantic skyscrapers, we've been to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moon. But the magnum opus, the peak of human accomplishments lies in Terraria. Terraria is nothing less than a genuine masterclass of video games, and it is a crime that this game costs only ten dollars. Nintendo charges 60 dollars for New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, which is a port of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wii U game which was already made from copy pasted elements from previous 2D Mario games in the first place, and this mind-blowing gem sells for 1/6th the price. Terraria has so much variety, so high a skill ceiling, so seamless a difficulty transition that it is nearly impossible to get bored of it. At the beginning of the game, you're fighting a big slime wearing a crown using this pathetic bow you made from some rocks you found underground. At the end of the game, however, you are fighting a god of death firing laser beams and eyeballs of death, while you are zooming around on a UFO shooting him in the forehead with a machine gun crafted from the fragments of a destroyed otherworldly pillar where you were shot at by mutant bugs that can cause your gravity to go out of wack when they get a hit in. The fact that the transition from the big slime to fighting actual gods is so seamless is nothing short of incredible, and the difficulty progression follows suit in its incredible execution. The game starts off so mindlessly easy, a toddler would scoff at it and play through effortlessly while blindfolded and missing multiple limbs. Then your first boss comes in and it's a little harder, you die a few times, but nothing that bad, But then as time goes on, the bosses increase in difficulty over time, to the point where you are dodging the gigantic lasers and eyeballs of death from the god of death mentioned earlier. But because the difficulty increase is so subtle, it never feels overwhelming. Although there are some difficulty dips from time to time, Golem being a prime example of this, there are very few difficulty jumps. The three difficulty modes are also very well integrated as well. It's almost like each mode is a continuation of the last, the beginning of expert is about as hard as the end of normal, and the beginning of master is about as hard as the end of expert. And I haven't even mentioned how much ♥♥♥♥ this game has. Thousands of items, hundreds of weapons, hundreds of enemies, events, bosses, dungeons, you fight the god of torches at one point. I've been playing this game for quite a while, I lost count, I think I have like 3 hours on it or something, and this game is still hitting me with things I didn't know previously existed. And the worlds of Terraria are huge, with many nooks and crannies to shove your dirty little fingers into, so you'll likely get a ton of playtime out of each individual world. And once you are done with one world, you make a new one, but with the added knowledge of the previous world under your belt. Maybe you learn how to better your constructions, maybe you learn how to exploit an enemy's AI in your favor. Learning how Terraria works and all the mechanics at play is so satisfying and so fun to employ, that it has kept me entertained for years, and is likely to keep me entertained for many years more. If you haven't gotten this game yet, please do. You're missing out on one of the greatest games ever created.","8,046.0",Recommended,"689 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-10-23 00:00:00,"My first ever Steam game. Boy was it a great 8 years, or however long it was. Sadly, the journey has come to an end. We all knew this was coming, after 1.3 came with the true endgame it was only a few years' time for the finale.  Back when I first joined, I was a little guy. Started playing back in the 1.1 days. I learned the ropes, and I had a lot of fun. Most of my time was occupied by another childhood favorite, Minecraft, however I played this quite often too. I found a server, and started playing some minigames, meeting people, and fighting bosses with them. Those times were great.  Then came 1.2, a glorious time. I started my first true playthrough, as a ranger, and was determined to beat the Golem, which I did after some time. I ended up painting my entire spawn in negative colors because I was bored. Those were also fun times.  After that came 1.3, the endgame. I wasn't playing it much during this time, due to not being able to use a computer, but I played it and it was enjoyable nonetheless. I met more people, played more games, did more playthroughs, and I ended up getting into mods.  But eventually, things go as they come.  1.4 is a bittersweet update, to say the least. It made the game look so much better, and performed smoother overall too. The changes added were astronomical, but nothing truly game-changing, well except for Empress of Light. The new Master mode is okay, but it lost so much potential it could have had. x10 spawnrate is also fun, but I only put some 40 hours into that. Got pretty far, but it just got too strenuous, with school starting up and all too.  A game I once knew to be simply three mechanical bosses and some hallowed gear changed into the vibrant landscape it is today, but never to change anymore. It's one of many relics lost to time of my childhood, and one that will go in my mind as a great memory collection, yet not to be added to much more. I might play this game here and there, but it just isn't what it used to be.  May I wish you all good luck in your virtues, and hope you all have a great time, as I once did. Just don't get it get to your heart too much, otherwise it will pull hard.","2,044.5",Recommended,"200 people found this review helpful

105600,2015-10-11 00:00:00,"Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.  Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).","2,951.1",Recommended,"372 people found this review helpful

Now that I've logged over 150 hours into it, I see that Terraria is so much more than Minecraft. When I tried to figure out what was better, I made a list. Hopefully, I can do this right: Exploration Terraria 2d side-scrolling Multitude of biomes to explore(Around 38)            (Terrria Wins)        (Terraria Wins)          (Terraria Wins)      (Terraria Wins)  In the end: Terraria-4 Minecraft-1 I can't believe you took the time to read all this.(Did you?)

105600,2017-12-04 00:00:00,"This is one of the best games ever made and the only reason it is not regarded as such is that it is not very accessible. I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don’t let its eye-candy graphics fool you…  You are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including “bosses”. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.  While you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your “shelter”. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.  Being a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture.  Whether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made.  Buy it full price. Developers are still updating content and supporting the game after all these years (without any paid DLCs whatsoever), they really deserve some support.",76.5,Recommended,"193 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-01-05 00:00:00,"Terraria is one of the best survival sandbox games to date. It might be relatively old now, but it's truly a great game to pick up to play alone or with friends.  This is the game I end up coming back to from time to time, as it provides lots of fun and many different things to do. Build, craft, fight, gather materials or items - it's all up to you. It's even more fun when you get into it with friends. The amount of content this game has to offer is enormous; fights are exciting, building is fun and highly enjoyable, finding various items is always nice. You can have fun things such as mounts and pets, or even a sword that shoots cats. Generally a super fun game with many possibilities.  Summary:  - LOTS of content. - Can be enjoyable even if you want to play alone. - A lot of stuff to do and places to explore. - Different content difficulties. - Might be confusing at the start, but gets super fun when you figure out things. - Huge amount of various in game items. - Soundtrack is one of the most enjoyable I've heard. - Plenty of different NPCs that will end up invading your home. - Possiblities for building are endless. It's very enjoyable and you can experiment with all kinds of blocks and decor.  Overall, this is an amazing sandbox game, with pretty much endless possibilities, and I highly recommend it!",196.7,Recommended,"194 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-02-06 00:00:00,"Terraria is an action-adventure sandbox game developed by Re-Logic.  👋 First impression  I've known about the game for a while, but I didn't want to try it because it had old graphics and people often compared it to Minecraft, but in the end it was well worth the experience.  ✔️Pros ❌Cons • Incredible amount of different weapons and classes  • Beautiful 2D world • No cons for this masterpiece   Ah ... What an adventure. You start by cutting down a tree and building a small rectangle for your first npc friend in the game, and you end up fighting aliens, crazy cultists, and other mad things. I thought I was getting into a relaxing game that wouldn't bother me at all, but ... well, I can say that there were some bosses who got me on my toes.  •  Crafting in this game is the thing that made the biggest and best impression to me. There are so many things you can do other things with ... When you're at the beginning of the game, it can swallow you. The most important thing is not to worry about using the internet in this game. The right way to play is with 25 tabs in Google Chrome open at the same time while trying to find the right item to craft.  •  At the beginning of the game, it is very important to build platforms that can be used to avoid the attacks of the bosses. I haven't played the game before this last patch, but as far as I've seen, videos showing people defeating bosses in an ""easy"" way with minimal movement are now updated and not working, so your mechanics will play a key role in your playthrough. Here may be the time to mention that I personally played in Expert and I was not alone, but а duo with a friend of mine.   After the last patch of the game there are a total of 104 achievements. A lot of them can be completed while preparing for bosses, end game, etc. Others want you to craft an item or do something, not that hard. In general, the achievements are not so difficult and can also be a good guide when you are wondering what to do. However, there is one achievement that will haunt you. HELPER MINION is the name of this nightmare. Remember this name and when you get into the game and have only this achievement left, come back to this review and leave a comment. The day I write this review I have 170 hours in the game and I am on quest number 158. Almost there, buds.    Honestly, I haven't tried the game in classic mode, but in expert mode it's not that easy, so I don't want to think about how it will be in master mode. However, if you do not have much time and just want to relax in the game, there is a modе for that. It was added in the latest patch 1.4 and is called journey mode. There a lot of things are made much easier and non-committal. In short, the game is as difficult as the player wants it to be.   The game is as beautiful as 2D graphics allow it to be. I find many of the things that can be found in the world of to be quite sweet and beautiful.   has over eighty music tracks across every version of the game. Each one will play and loop endlessly while the player is in a specific biome or while certain events are taking place. All the music in was composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly of Resonance Array. I didn't have to play music from YouTube at all, so I find the game's music good and fitting.   I had no problems at all.  Game tested on:   The game itself is cheap and definitely worth the full price, so if you think you want to play it a lot, don't hesitate and take it. Waiting for a discount is also not a bad idea to save some money, but be sure to take this game. For the time you can spend in it, this amount of money is negligible.",195.5,Recommended,"196 people found this review helpful

This game is a work of art and having grown up with it for almost 9 years with almost 2,000 hours played, I can confidently say that I 100% recommend this game. The extremely satisfying progression throughout the game, the wonderful and cute pixel art, the limitless replay value, and of course not to mention the insane bosses are just a few things that make this game stand unchallenged above any other game I've ever played. The system of different classes to choose from and hundreds of weapon types in each class make replaying the game not only fun but continuously satisfying as you continue to upgrade your weapons and armor and power. The tools for building and customizing your worlds allows for very unique and limitless construction.

However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends.",754.9,Recommended,"1,173 people found this review helpful

105600,2015-06-20 00:00:00,"Terraria  Terraria is an amazingly fun to play 2D sandbox game. You start off with nothing but as you discover Terraria you notice how much is in this game.  Stats  Here are some general stats about Terraria to give you an idea of how impressive this game is.  Terraria contains:  - 2748 Items - 401 enemies - 76 potions - 69 swords - 34 bows - 30 guns - 21 bosses  As you can see Terraria contains a massive collection of fun.   You will start off by creating your character and creating your world. A nice feature to note is that you can have your character travel through multiple worlds while keeping their items. You will be thrust into a new world where you will have to gather resources and upgrade your arsenal. Night in Terraria is not as forgiving as Minecraft. After you survive you will continue to build up your personal collection while building a house. You will build a house so that random people can move in take up a room and rip you off with prices (jk not all prices are bad). Eventually you shall fight your first boss and bosses in Terraria will give you a run for your money so you better be prepared guys and gals.   Terraria is a fun game and even more fun with friends. Friends will help you out and make it easier to advance without dying.... too much :D. However if you do not feel like playing multiplayer singleplayer is just as fun. In single player you do not have to share your loot and your friends are incapable of stealing it, because it is singlepalyer.   Hardmode is a gamemode that Terraria automatically places you in after you beat The Wall of Flesh. In Hardmode you will meet new bosses and new enemies. You will find new materials and you will quickly realize every is much tougher and you need to quickly upgrade yourself.    + Smooth gameplay + Have not felt lag as of yet + character customization + huge amount of weapons + HARDCORE + entertaining for hours + huge amount of armour sets with special abilities   - a lot to grasp for a new player to Terraria (I dont think i can think of any more)   Terraria is an amazing 2D sandbox that tests you. This game has given me hours upon hours of fun and I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who has money in their wallet.",302.2,Recommended,"237 people found this review helpful

105600,2017-06-27 00:00:00,"Lets get into it shall we  Terraria, the game that makes you question your life choices more than a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book on existentialism. I've spent more time in this pixelated wonderland than I have in the real world, and let me tell you, I regret nothing. My therapist might disagree, but what does she know about the joys of defeating pixelated bosses and building houses for NPCs who can't even say ""thank you""?  With over 1200 hours logged, I can confidently say that Terraria is not just a game; it's a way of life. Forget sunshine and fresh air; I've got mushrooms and glowing ore to keep me company. Who needs friends when you have a loyal army of NPCs, each with their unique quirks and questionable fashion sense?  The variety in this game is mind-boggling. I mean, where else can you go from fighting a gigantic eye to crafting a rainbow gun that shoots unicorns? It's like a fever dream mixed with a dash of pure, unadulterated awesomeness. Terraria is the only place where you can go from feeling like a badass ninja to a master chef whipping up delicacies for your digital neighbors.  Speaking of neighbors, those NPCs are a special bunch. They move in, mooch off your hospitality, and somehow manage to get themselves killed by zombies every other night. It's like living in a retirement home for video game characters, and I love it. Who wouldn't want a nurse, a wizard, and a gun-slinging arms dealer as roommates?  The building aspect of Terraria is like playing with virtual Legos, only better. Sure, you could build a modest little house, but why stop there when you can create a floating island with a disco floor and lava waterfalls? My creativity knows no bounds, and neither does the game's ability to let me indulge in my architectural fantasies.  Terraria is the only game that has me questioning whether I've been spending too much time in the real world. Why go outside when I can explore the vast reaches of the underworld, battle mythical beasts, and collect rare artifacts? The real world doesn't have pixelated penguins, and that's a deal-breaker for me.  In conclusion, Terraria is not just a game; it's a lifestyle. I highly recommend it to anyone who values creativity, exploration, and the ability to ignore real-world responsibilities. With 1200+ hours under my belt, I can confidently say that Terraria is the reason my plants are dead, my dog is hungry, and my social life is practically nonexistent. And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. Five stars, two thumbs up, and a digital high five to the developers for creating this masterpiece. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dungeon to raid and a virtual pet to feed.","1,263.4",Recommended,"841 people found this review helpful

At first I checked it out and was like ""Yeah, this looks kinda like Minecraft in 2D"" and I got into exploring the world, finding items and quickly realized there is WAY MORE than I expected.  In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it. I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun.  I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime.  Do I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely! If you don't mind the slow beginning and love exploring and experimenting with new stuff this game is for you!

105600,2013-11-26 00:00:00,"To commemorate the beta of Steam Reviews, as well as passing 1,000 hours in Team Fortress 2, it only makes sense that I finally write a recommendation for a game that has been close to my heart since the day I was first introduced to it: Terraria.  Terraria has proven to be a lot of fun to play, and has been one of my biggest video game time sinks in recent years because of it. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a broad permittance for exploration and a wide selection of building decor, it's the type of game that strikes me as having something for everyone. Which is good, when you consider that it also has multiplayer. Even better when you get to the late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors and tools to allow for a wide variety of specializations.  Building and exploration are strong points in favor of the game, but the gameplay mechanics are something I'd like to single out for praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a lot of spectacle, and perhaps that's part of why I find it so charming. Hurting enemies--even those who are vastly inferior to you--feels good. It's satisfying to hear the hit sound on the more squishy enemies, and watch them explode into fine little chunks when they die. Ground movement could be better, but certain late game items give you the ability to dash and fly, which really expand how you can explore and fight. And with a wide selection of weapons, every player is bound to find a roster of tools, spells and fish-related artillery that fits their playstyle.  The game isn't without flaws, mind you. With the game's update history, the launch endgame now vastly differs from that of the current one. This has led to some balance and progression issues, the most glaring of which being how sluggish the early game feels. It worries me that the start of the game might dissuade some people from playing, when they might love what the late game has to offer. The game also has a bad habit of recycling mob AI with reskins, though this is averted by adjusting certain parameters and giving them unique abilities to hide the fact. Even though I have more to say about the shortcomings, there's just too much good in the game to stay mad about what effectively boils down to nitpicking.  Plus, it has hats. Any game that has a selection of hats gets brownie points.  Watch some trailers. Read some other reviews. If this looks like something you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a chance. The game occasionally goes on sale for 75% off, so pick up a four pack for yourself and three friends. If I'm wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I'm sorry. But if I'm right, then it'll be well worth the price. We're expected to pay $60 these days for a fulfilling gaming experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.","2,093.0",Recommended,"2,018 people found this review helpful

105600,2023-11-15 00:00:00,"I wanted to write this review after I spent enough time in the game and have gotten most of the achievements. So now that I’m about 109/115 achievements & 100 hours playtime, I feel I can finally give an adequate review.  I felt this game was hard to get into at the beginning but if you have someone help you through the first steps in learning the game play and crafting mechanics, it gets easier and more fun. It’s hard because at the start, you basically are some weak homeless dude and have to fight off slimes, collect and craft, materials build your own house before it gets dark (and pretty much do this for the entirety of the game but as you progress, you get to upgrade your gear and it gets easier). It sounds like a grind but it’s well-worth it. It’s somewhat satisfying to build yourself up from the beginning, from wood walls to the solar or vortex brick or something.  The coolest part of the game is the crafting and building aspects of it. There’s so many different types of materials, which you can make into various styles of brick or wall paper, even furniture (like balloon furniture). There’s so much customizability in how you can build your houses. There’s different environments or “biomes” so you build houses that are befitting of that specific biome and then you get NPC’s to move in. You can also collect weird paintings which you can decorate your houses with.  There’s different game modes too so if you want a challenge, you can play hardcore or if you just want to build, you can do journey mode which allows you to duplicate items so you don’t have to destroy your world mining it all. It’s one of those games where there’s no right way to play. Play how you want and play how you think is most fun. The music and the scenery in the game is also very pleasant, so it’s a very nice chill relax game. It’s nice solo and coop. 10/10 would recommend.          Notice, I didn't mention combat in my review. Eh, it's not my type of game combat wise but that's the beauty of this game. There's different game modes where you can choose what type of experience you want from the game. Some go for those hardcore challenge runs and I go for Journey mode because I love the buidling and crafting elements.",253.8,Recommended,"117 people found this review helpful

Whenever I play it feels like I'm progressing whether it be getting a new weapon, killing a boss or just building a really nice house for an NPC it always feels like I'm moving forward. Surprisingly, the game hasn't really seemed to show any signs of its age despite being almost 9 years old at this point. The music is fantastic especially during boss fights. Boss fights have a perfect challenge level when you do them with the intended gear and there are a whole lot of bosses to fight throughout the game. The game has a ""halfway point"" just when you start to feel established which really puts you back on your toes and creates an excellent dynamic without taking anything away from the player. Expert mode feels like a perfect challenge for people who have a lot of experience by adding new mechanics or just small buffs to each boss.

105600,2019-08-28 00:00:00,"2D Minecraft? What a load of nonsense!  One of the best games in history.  Almost as good as modded Terraria.  Edit (22.02.2021)- WAS BETTER BEFORE 1.4! Still a good game, just not as good as before imo. As an avid Minecraft fan (hence my referral to Minecraft in my original review), I feel like 1.3.5 was the MC Java of Terraria and 1.4 is the bedrock. I still recommend the game very highly, though, even if I do not like the ""rebalancing"" and some of the new and occasionally unfitting (in my opinion) content, it is still a solid, amazing game, at the end of the day  Edit (05/02/2025)- I've been playing 1.4 a lot now and I think the 1.4 content is now properly into the game, well balanced and works. Got to say on further review, 1.4 was a good update; it just had its issues but they've now been fixed and the game is better for it.","1,540.0",Recommended,"261 people found this review helpful

Years ago when I first bought this game I've played through it at least fifty times, maybe more, with different class biases and challenges, mods and on expert mode.  It's simply a wonderfully fun, in depth game, with so much replayability and different styles to play, that I'd reccommend it to anyone even remotely interested in it by the screenshots and videos on this store page. It's well worth it even at full price, but hey if you can get it on sale - which it goes on sale pretty often nowadays - then that's even better.","1,358.9",Recommended,"115 people found this review helpful

105600,2024-09-14 00:00:00,"10/10 game. One of the best I've ever played, and there's a bunch of reasons why. Mostly though :  The developers - Relogic is a wonderful firm, that listens to its players. They've created a masterpiece and I thank them for it.  The community - This player base is friendly, creative and helpful. It's got everything. What more could you ask for?  The game in its entirety - Features cool worlds, items, animals, subtle story, and all of them come with consistently amazing updates. The scenery is beautiful (in its own way). Easter eggs and funny items is one of my favourite parts of the game. Never gets boring.  Every masterpiece has its own flaws, in this case :  Crossplay - Or should i say the lack there of.  Grinding - Some parts of the game are a bit too repetitive and annoying.  And notably :  The angler.

105600,2022-07-14 00:00:00,"So lets say hypothetically, you have a friend who in three hours doesn't let you kill the first boss, makes probably 10 graveyards, did less than 5 damage to a WORM, gives you his shoddy pickaxe and small axe every half a minute, blows you and the houses you made up (repair not included), gives you the critters he collected with his stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bug net, manages to die in the same pit like 15 times (which he managed to kill OTHER people while killing HIMSELF), dies to the weakest enemy in the game, gives you 5 goldfish and complains when you don't give them back (because you didn't look in your HOTBAR for them??), opens the doors so literally anything and everything can come in the house (even from other biomes), and has the strongest armor out of the group but dies tenfold compared to everyone else.

105600,2021-12-16 00:00:00,"The amount of labor, love, and time that the developers have spent fine-tuning and improving this game is truly astounding. With over 5000 items, 28 bosses and minibosses, easy multiplayer access, and mod support all wrapped up into a $10 bundle with no extra microtransactions or DLC, Terraria is a masterpiece that large-scale game companies could only dream of making. A single playthrough can easily last you over 30+ hours, for most, that is barely the tip of the iceberg.  This is a game that you can play and replay multiple times and still discover new items and mechanics with each playthrough. Every new world is a new adventure, a new place for creativity, an escape from reality to let your inner imagination run loose. Nothing pushes or pressures you to rush through the game, it is a self-paced journey that, despite the many labels put onto it, has no real end. Some people play the game to find new items and accessories, others play to build the ideas that live in their minds, but no matter how you decide to play the game, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Relogic called the 1.4 update “Journey’s End,” but I think that, even now, it is just the beginning.  In addition to all of this, the multiplayer in this game is absolutely phenomenal. Playing, chatting, and enjoying the game with friends is an incredible experience*. The pacing of the game barely changes compared to single-player and the atmosphere and ideas that can run through your world can be incredible. Access to the steam workshop, a place where you can share your creations or see the creations of others, is also a great addition to the game**.   Unfortunately, no game can be perfect in every way, I do have a few minor issues with the game.  RNG: Most items in Terraria are commonly available throughout the game. However, a very select few are very Rng dependent and can often feel like a chore to grind for. Fortunately, most of these items are entirely optional such as the information accessories and some late-game boss drops. Summoner Class: There are 4 main fighting classes in the game, Melee, Ranger, Mage, and Summoner. The latter is a unique class that uses minions to fight for you. This is a fantastic concept, but it is very poorly executed due to the lack of variety of summoner weapons and armor. Master Mode is a new difficulty in Terraria that was added in the 1.4 update, which increases the difficulty of the game by tripling the monster’s health and damage… that’s it. Other than a few extra cosmetic items, Master Mode is simply Expert Mode but with more enemy health. It doesn’t add anything new or interesting so it is usually best to just avoid it unless you are into that type of gameplay.  These are very minor flaws with the game and absolutely do not impact the overall gameplay or enjoyability at all. Terraria is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have had, the time I spent playing by myself and friends during the lockdown was definitely time well spent. If you are someone who enjoys building games, combat of all types, exploration, or just want a game that is a mixture of all of these, then I definitely recommend buying this game. If Relogic had made the updates cost money, then I absolutely would have paid, and the fact that they continue to add free updates to this game 10 years after its release just goes to show how much they care about their player and fanbase, and that is absolutely something I am willing to support.   * If you plan to start a multiplayer world with more than two people, I highly recommend playing on an expert mode world because of the modified boss drops. If you play on a normal world, then you will get boss drops equivalent to the boss drops of single-player, whereas an expert world’s boss drops are equivalent to the number of players on the world.   ** Terraria also has fantastic mod support, with the developers at Relogic just recently updating TModLoader to 1.4, and though I have never played modded Terraria, I have heard fantastic things about all kinds of community creations.   TL;DR Good game, you should buy",457.9,Recommended,"149 people found this review helpful

105600,2019-10-08 00:00:00,"Is exactly what it depicts on the trailer, and more  Calling Terraria a 2D clone of Minecraft is doing both games a disservice. Sure, Terraria shares the sandbox and building aspects, but it really shines in its exploring capabilities.  As many have commented before, the game has tons of exploring to do. Not just mining for better equipment, mind you, but also looking out for helpful NPCs, discovering secrets below (and above!), learning how to deal with the enemies, the terrain and the bosses. Preparing your fort against invasions, creating the perfect place to relax... and all of this is before Hardmode, where the real meat of the game lies.  Terraria is a bit obscure by design. It's meant to be taken as a world to explore, a world of unknowns. Finding new things, trying new strategies is the heart and soul of this game.  as of the time of writing this review, the developers have supported and expanded this game for 8 years now, without DLC or microtransactions BS. Think about that the next time you see an Early Access game rushed out.  Even if you pay full price for this game, you're getting one of the best games on Steam when it comes to price per hours played. Seriously, you're getting quite a bang for your buck here,",400.7,Recommended,"134 people found this review helpful

105600,2018-04-14 00:00:00,"A game developed and published by Re-Logic.  Terraria, an interesting title, where your imagination determines how far you can progress, and how much time you will pour into this game. A hollow world till you arrive, teeming with precious ores, and dark secrets. Fetid swamps and dry deserts. This game is definitely an endeavour, and it will soak up alot of your time as you try and reach the pinnacle of your characters limitations and how much you can construct. Often remarked as a ""2D Minecraft"" I always find this comparison woefully incorrect. Minecraft has a wide selection of enemies, which is similar, A wide array of ore and precious gems to mine, which is also similar. But from then one, Terraria leaves it dead in the water. An RPG experience, with substantial boss progression, Active try and retry game mechanics and spanning character classes, All inclusive of a massive crafting system, and wide assortment of things to collect and try. Anyways, I've praised it enough, lets get down to the review!  Graphics: Probably one of the weaker points of the game, Its still very vibrant and holds upto despite its 2011, Birthdate. This is mainly due to the pixelated graphics and 2D perspective of the game. Not alot to render, and not alot to process at any one time, Making it run very smoothly at any point in time, But also extremely limited due to there not being any sort of graphical options or benchmarks.  Gameplay: Where do i begin. This game plays, as well as you can play it. All the mechanics are there for you to make it work in your favor. But finding your niche and finding your work space is all crucial in you enjoying your time in Terraria. The game drops you into a world, where you basically don't understand anything, A very limited spread of understanding, very few tools at your disposal, and a single NPC to help guide you along your journey. 4 classes to basically choose from as you progress through the game, Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. All depending on how you want to play and how you prefer to play. Despite there being no relevant story or backstory to this game, there is a substantial amount of progression and ALOT of gear to rummage around for.  Story: I think i pretty much covered this aspect of the game already. There really isn't a story here. Which is usually a game killer for me. I heavily invest in story driven worlds, And this world has none to speak of. I guess the story can be made up for each player, as to why you are doing what you're doing, but as for a story driven narrative. There isn't one.  I don't often do a ""CONS"" section. But this game is so monstrous in terms of scope and size, I feel it's necessary to provide as much information as possible. I love this game to bits, this is perhaps the 3rd time i've played it through, Once on playstation, once on Xbox and now on PC. So i'm well aware of his rather frustrating flaws. So here we are.... Cons: This game despite how much effort has been poured into it, Has rather sizable and numerous flaws. Mostly relating around achievement glitches, game crashing and multiplayer bugs. Achievement glitches are fairly frustrating, although are entirely not a concern unless you're as OCD as i am. The game progresses the same way regardless of steams registering of your progress. Game crashes for alot of players at certain intervals in the game, Which HAS caused loss of character saves. It's highly recommended that you cloud save your favorite character builds and worlds, so that your save data will always be present. And Multiplayer as a whole is a fairly awful experience, the above mention bugs as well as an assortment of new things, Players not seeing what each other are seeing, Enemies and bosses despawning because of numerous players involved, which may or may not potentially ruin hours upon hours of preparation and planning. Frustrating to say the least. But alot of it is avoidable if you take necessary precautions. Alot of which can be found through quick internet searches.  Overall: This game is a gigantic time suck lol There is no other way to put it, You will pour time into boss by boss progression, farming and grinding enemies for specific gear to better improve your chances at the next boss. You will dig deep into dirt, mud and ash for hours upon hours just to find 3 pieces of ore which isn't even close to the amount you need. You will kill thousands of enemies for a single piece of gear, that isn't even optimal till you find another piece it can be fused with. You will die on the inside for days and potentially weeks as you farm your way to the very end of the game. And then when it's all over and you finally can get a breath of respite as your real life world is crumbling to pieces around you, You will feel empty, knowing that it's done. This game isn't just worth its price, It's worth every minute you pour into it. Welcome to Terraria. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do.",202.8,Recommended,"110 people found this review helpful

105600,2016-11-18 00:00:00,"This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.  I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.  There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best ""graphics"" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.  I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!",458.4,Recommended,"176 people found this review helpful

105600,2022-03-16 00:00:00,"As someone who's over 1800 hours in, I can tell you with confidence that this game is a MASTERPIECE. There are A LOT of things I could say about Terraria, but put quite simply: it's worth every penny.  The bosses are a blast, each class is fun in their own unique way, Expert difficulty is perfection (Normal is too easy and you get less loot; don't ever play on Normal), even the NPCs all have their uses! Technically speaking, an NPC is only ever useless depending on your class or personal preference (e.g. some people may not care for the Angler achievements, or a mage might not care for the Arms Dealer, etc.).  You will always have something to do, at pretty much any given point in the game. And even when you've 'beaten' the game and gotten bored of your world, you could just make a new character, new world, and have a totally new experience! Then, even if you get bored of that, you can download tModloader for FREE, and mod the game to your hearts' content!  It's affordable, can run on most hardware, and is, dare-I-say, the perfect gaming experience. I can't recommend this game enough.","2,634.7",Recommended,"130 people found this review helpful

She fought off slimes and zombies while I established gardens for mushrooms, trees, and plants for potion ingredients. We mined, we explored dungeons and caves, we fought bosses and discovered how to navigate Hell.  It's been an amazing time, and this game has been well worth the amount of money I've spent on it.

I've played this on console ever since I was little waiting for the update on 1.3 and it came but by the time it did I had switched to PC for this game and so had my friends. Writing this now I'm quite far away from my old friends but I'll be beat if I ever said no to playing Terraria with them. Get some friends on this game and make some memories, you'll enjoy it. And for the older and experienced players, keep that magic that you have with your friends. Very few people have that- even if it's just for a game. But isn't that really what it's about? Spending time, riffing and coupling the day to have a 1-hour pixel adventure. PLEASE play this game with friends. I would hate to have to see people playing Terraria alone because it makes me sad that you can't enjoy it with pals. Maybe it should be a recipe for all video games really, I mean even the first few games were made for two people. Games like pong and others require two people.

105600,2022-06-14 00:00:00,"I just recently broke 1000 hours on this game, so I feel obligated to review it (and I want to, too!).  You’d think that if I’ve played something for a thousand hours, I must like it. And you’d be right. Terraria is… the best game I have ever played. But first, I must give you a little history of myself.  So, Terraria is the first real desktop game I played. By real, I mean not on a web browser (I played lots of arras.io). Before Terraria, I played Minecraft on my iPad. But only creative mode. I really liked building in Minecraft. Anyways, I was at a friend’s house, and my friend understood that I didn’t play any video games, so they let me try this game on their computer. I had no idea how to play, but I still liked it. Then, when I got my laptop, they bought me this game. We started playing it together, the three of us (one other friend as well). We finished the game in Normal mode while basically knowing little about how the game worked. Hell, we didn’t even know about double jumps, dashes, or the Goblin Tinkerer. We didn’t know why Moon Lord (the last boss) seemed to not be taking any damage. (After, we realized that he summons things that heal him unless you killed them. Even if we had realized at the time, we weren’t doing enough damage to kill the clots in time, anyways. I died 30 times and healed with the nurse more than 40 times in the winning fight. The fight took 45 minutes with the three of us. In classic mode, boss health doesn’t even scale, so we should have killed it in 2 minutes, because the average kill time for one person is 6 minutes.) Sorry if you have no idea what I’m talking about.  After that first multiplayer playthrough, I spent all my time reading the wiki and watching all sorts of youtube videos. Not even playing, just reading and watching. I memorized all the important things about the game, and learned insane strategies. And then I found multiplayer servers.  I had no idea what servers were at the time. I followed a youtube video to join one. I was immediately overwhelmed. So confusing stuff. So, there’s this server software thing called TShock which is essentially a mod for servers. You can teleport people, give them items, butcher enemies, etc. All by typing in a command! (For those of you that play minecraft, think of the command console. Same idea.) I have the capacity to learn quickly, so I did. The server had all sorts of stuff. I became proficient at the minigames. As of this review, over 700 of my 1000 hours on the game are on that one server. I have tried other servers, but that one is the best, in my opinion. (IP: penguingames.fun Port: 7777)  The bad side of playing on servers is that you don’t improve much at the regular game. The minigames (such as Parkour) use weird techniques and stuff that you will never use in a normal playthrough. So, even after all these hours, I am very. Very. Bad. At the base game. But I know the theory and stats.  Okay, here’s the actual review. Gameplay 10/10. Decoration 8/10. Sprites 8/10. Animation 7/10. UI 8.5/10. Very balanced game overall. In classic/normal mode, if you pay enough attention, you will rarely die. In master mode (hardest mode), everything kills you in 2 or 3 hits, maybe 5 with endgame overpowered armor and stuff. Lots of unique items. Over 15 bosses to fight. Some bosses are bullet hell-type. 10 or so biomes to explore, plus unique structures. Enemies are interesting. Most major bugs have been fixed.  Lastly, let’s look at mods. These are player/fan-made additions to the game. Mods can be played using tModLoader, a game that you can get for free on steam if you own terraria. I’m not going to cover how to install them. Mods vary from overhauling the game, adding better sprites (wait, actually that’s a texture pack), quality of life, new bosses, new AI for enemies in the base game, to adding extra-large worlds and doubling the number of items. All that! Just for 10 dollars (5 while on sale).  I haven’t completed any singleplayer playthrough of this game (had other stuff to do), but I am working on defeating all bosses without taking damage. I have also played a few other games since I got this one, namely: DRG (deep rock galactic), Core Keeper, Geometry Dash, and Splitgate. Terraria is still the most fun…  TL,DR: great gameplay, feels smooth and semi-balanced (logic is weird though), lots of content, cheap for the price, endless possibilities. You can build amazing stuff. Overall rating 9.5/10. Get this game. Thanks for reading!

105600,2023-07-10 00:00:00,"Calling it ""2D Minecraft"" is a gross disservice to this masterclass of pixel survival mining. The game is full of soul and whimsy. More than any in its category that I have found to date. You can regulate the challenge level to perfectly match your preferences depending on how deep you delve and at every single echelon of progression you can let your imagination soar for scores of hours on end. The planet sized playground that calls itself Terraria blows my little mind.",109.8,Recommended,"244 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-08-18 00:00:00,"As of writing this review I have invested 1038 hours into this game and I have been waiting for a good time to post a review and I think now is a good time. Terraria is a game were you explore craft and fight many exciting bosses. First up, I have found that the replayability is never a problem saying that I have had countless playthroughs and each one has never been quite the same. Terraria offers 4 different classes (Melee, Ranged, Magic and Summoner) to play as and each one has its own way to play. Terraria's progression is fantastic! You start with nothing but, once you kill your first boss you can start to feel that much deserved power spike. Terraria's progression is filled with 17 bosses that give the player new items and unlocks new tiers of loot and harder bosses. Some of the games core bosses are not necessary to fight in order to move on with the game which is a nice addition. Terraria's events are completely optional but they offer new and strong weapons, armor and accessories to spice things up. Terraria can be played with your friends also which just adds to the amount of fun that you can have when playing. If you ever get bored of the content that is in the game, Terraria offers official mod support! that gives a countless selection of mods to play around with. Terraria also has it's own official Wiki page that can give you information on any aspect of the game and it's mechanics. Final Thought: I bought Terraria back when it was 20$ and looking back on that purchase I regret nothing. I have found myself coming back to this game over and over again over the years. This game is an absolute GEM of a game and for 10$ it's such a steal!","1,338.9",Recommended,"119 people found this review helpful

105600,2023-10-16 00:00:00,"Today Terraria and I, we have our anniversary, ten years together! More than 1700 hours of great fun and memorable moments, most of this I played solo but there were times when I shared my adventures with friends (although its about 500 hours while 1200 solo). Terraria is a great game and one of the greatest ever made, not only because of this constant labours of love but also because the great gameplay loop, graphics, music and atmosphere. While I don't have the most hours and I am definitely not the best player, this game to this day gives me the best enjoyment (and also best tediousness). The thing I like the most about it (probably) is the connection that was established between gamers and Terraria (well, mostly its developer Re-Logic). Taking input, talking to fans, giving them updates (even If they want them or not) and being quite nice towards other developers (reminder of their contribution to GODOT engine). That the feel of community between creator&recipient helped the game for such a long stay on top with positive reviews and positive attitude towards it.  However all good things must come to the end. What will happen when that last update will come (maybe it will never)? Will there be another project, studio, return to updates after promising no more or simply T2? Will it surpass the original or maybe will bring something completely new? I trust Re-Logic, they earned it, there will be something great in the future, May the expectations/fans not kill anything new, other than Terraria.  Terraria is one of those games that happens once in a lifetime, I am glad it was part of my life for the last 10 years! May the next 10 years also bring the great time!  Ps1 I also have one unfulfilled dream with Terraria, that maybe will come with help of the modders. For the longest of time there was one Corruption and one Hallow, later came Crimson to paint the world red. I really would like to see another late game Holy/Good, alternate Hallow.","1,832.0",Recommended,"142 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-11-26 00:00:00,"(it contain small spoilers what is ahead, skip this story if you just want to witness yourself and go directly to quick review section. Also I kinda had to update this review a little bit, minor fixing on my writing and maybe adding some more stuff for my story part.)  Terraria...  It's been over 9 years since it has been released on steam and perhaps still over 9 years since I got my hands on this pure gem.  When I first time saw this as pretty foolish person and thinking this being just ""2D Minecraft"" but thankfully I was completely wrong about it and getting really into this game.  Sure your first time playing this game might be so slow and boring, but once you get your hands on very interesting gears and meet very important people that sells even much more interesting stuff, then this game slowly starting to get some speed, also don't forget to build houses for them.  The first time when I was capable enough to take on the Wall of Flesh, I was very certain this was the final boss of the game, until for the surprise it unlocked the hardmode and I reacted by saying: ""I'm sorry what?""  Upon that moment I realized the adventure was just getting started, but eventually I was getting bored with the game even couple years later when I played with group of friends, it didn't take long until we decided to stop playing. Although I did enjoy the fun time in the game and I will never forget that time when I tricked someone to step on the pressure plate that was rigged with explosives.  Few years later I decided to check back in the game and wow how much it has been changed from and started to play again to see what new and exciting things to discover and this time I did play little bit longer.  On this time I felt it gave more content than enough for me to at least write down the review, but oddly enough it felt like it was missing something from all this so I decided not to make the review.  Upon this year near spring time, they announced upcoming perhaps truly final update for the game: ""Journey's End""  That update was a huge one when it arrived and I personally felt like it is finally time to finally finish this game on hardest possible difficulty, so I finally created my final character, my final world, readying my copper blade and getting almost instantly killed by green slime!  Yes...  it is that hard, but I decided to keep going even if it was going to drive me completely insane because of it, until on that moment when I soldiered on this pure madness, I finally was face to face with the official final boss of Terraria... The Moon Lord and boy how much tries it took until I was near only 3 HP left on my character before finally defeating it and it never felt so good when I saw it dying and seeing the credit rolling for the first time.  But...  Now I feel this adventure isn't just over yet, especially when they added new content and I now have a urge to conquer the master mode and something else from beyond.  Now for the actual review.   Goods  +Gameplay Gameplay of the game is very simple at first, but it steadily get harder when you find new tools, weapons and trinkets that give you new way to play the game and there are basically ""classes"" on the game, for example: warrior, summoner, archer/gunner and mage, there are more ""classes"" but you can make your own ""class"" by mixing up the armor, trinkets and others giving you chance to experiment every items what you find and what mostly suit your style.  +Art style The art style of the game is really pretty and all these years the art style has been improved quite a lot and especially the background since every area change the scenery and certain event affect the scenery as well, there are also lots of small details to see and some few changes on clouds as well.  +Music The music of this game is pure classic and all of them did have the tunes improved little bit and few news has been added after the journey's end update, there is also now otherworld version of ost that you can change it in the game after finding the certain secret.  +Price It's literally 10€ for several hours of fun and especially with friends.   Decents  =playtime You can easily sink great amount of time on either playing the game to end, crafting your perfect world or anything else, although if you just made completely new character and new world, the playtime might take quite a time until you get on the speed.  =Loot drop chance It might be little bit annoying to try getting the certain items from certain enemy, but there are few ways to make it easier.   Bads  -bugs/crashing I can't think of anything else being bad than bugged game or game crashing out of nowhere, but these are so rare you could just say: ""what bugs?""   Conclusion This game is pure classic since it was almost 10 years of it release on steam and this ""final"" update really show how much RE-Logic care about this game and it's fans, not only you get this great game pretty cheap, you also get lots of fun to explore the world, fighting powerful enemies, finding awesome treasures, build your own world and last but most importantly making your own story on this game on yourself or with your friends.  Welp, that's all for now.  Doktor Greenman, logging out.",781.1,Recommended,"153 people found this review helpful

My son found this game at Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. Thank you <3",101.2,Recommended,"637 people found this review helpful

I still remember the days when killing skeletron was considered endgame, good days. The devs've made an insane progress since then and only for the best - I couldn't imagine Terraria would turn into such content rich and entertaining sandbox.  Why do I reccomend it? That's why: - Fast paced, stylish (even though very simple) combat - Attractive pixel graphics - Well done character/world progression - Beautiful environment - A lot to explore, every playthrough is somewhat different - Great soundtrack - You can build! And it actually has a purpose! - Every boss is forever in my heart<3 - Customize character looks (very important for me) - Even better with friends - And the last, but not the least - the game doesn't require a NASA computer to play it  10 slimes out of 10 slimes!

105600,2023-03-04 00:00:00,"The Journey Has Ended, and What A Ride  Terraria is a video game. You can play it. I hope this information does not startle you. It's a 2D game that, at first blush, evokes Minecraft - It's open world, it's got base building, it's got monster slaughter by the gallons, it's got fishing, good lord has it got fishing, it's got potion-making, it's got a lot of something for everybody.  Your first mistake is in assuming it's just 2D Minecraft. It's not. It's a bit more linear, for one thing; Your progression is a little nebulous, but it begins with digging. You can dig up ores and craft stuff, so you do this for a while, slowly getting stronger and stronger. Then you discover that, no, Terraria has plans for you. Your nights might begin peacefully, calm even, but this is a lull before the game punches you in the stomach with your first boss fight.  Thankfully for your sanity, the game does offer several means of making this progression less of a guessing game. You have an NPC guide who can tell you what your next few moves should be, from getting stronger, to what boss fights you'll need to do next, to just offering miscellaneous tips and suggestions. In fact, your towns are a priority. You'll attract more and more NPCs as the game goes on, each offering services for coins you'll collect while slaughtering monsters. From items, to healing on the cheap, to modifying items, NPCs will cover a wide array of useful things, so it's always worth having them around, but to have them, you'll need houses.  You keep this loop going, and eventually the game opens up more and more as you get further along. So on, and so forth.  There's something for everyone. If you want to go into combat with melee, archery, guns, summoning minions, or wielding magic, the game accommodates all these styles, giving them their own strengths and drawbacks. If you want to build, the game offers you a lot of options for materials, paints, making buildings look nice, and as the game goes on, you'll be able to dabble in engineering. This said, having a combat 'class' is a must, as you'll need to fight to make progress.  In short, Terraria offers everyone, of all playstyles, a way to enjoy themselves.  The story is there, on the website, but it also doesn't really matter at all. It's certainly worth looking up if you're really invested into Terraria, but it's not going to affect gameplay at all, so there's no need to bother.  Graphically, Terraria... Really does resemble Minecraft in two dimensions. It's pixelated art can vary from cheery and colorful to eldritch or disgusting on a dime, a cheerful facade hiding grim undertones. It's also very easy on the eyes as a whole, so that's a plus, and it can cover and convey a variety of themes, locales, enemies, and bosses without anything feeling dissonant from where it's supposed to be as a result.  In terms of sounds, Terraria's music can, again, range from cheerfully peppy to hopelessly bleak at a moment's notice, and in a lot of cases can do so with absolute whiplash between normal and , and enemy sound effects cover a melange of themes and sounds, from the light of the Hallow, to the suitably spooky 'evil' biomes, to the underground desert's dryer tones. It all never feels too out of place, but it can grate a little given time.  Performance-wise, I admit to wielding an overkill PC, but the game never stutters or falters, even on older hardware - For as deep as Terraria is, it's remarkably lightweight and easy to run.  Multiplayer is a key selling point of Terraria. There's a 4-pack of copies you can buy so you can give three more buddies the game, and it's undeniably far better with friends then solo. Not only is it more people, but having a friend to laugh over luck with or share in the glory is always a good thing in my book, and on that front, Terraria more then delivers, both in co-operative play and competition via PvP.  I don't have many gripes with Terraria. Some of it's systems can be frustrating, and the RNG reliance hurts somewhat, but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying all my time spent with the game. Still, for some players, the game's progression can be a bit too vague and frustrating, trying to find where to go can be an exercise in patience sometimes, and when the RNG decides to screw you over, it really does not hold back on that front.  Even then, it's a fun time, and at only ten dollars, it's very much worth the base asking price. If you've ever wanted to know what Minecraft could do if it was a little less open-ended, Terraria is a worthwhile time, especially with buddies.",454.6,Recommended,"109 people found this review helpful

105600,2016-10-18 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Holy hell. What a ride this has been.  I first recieved this game when I was selected as the winner of a giveaway. I thought, ""Whatever, I've played Minecraft. This game is probably the exact same as it."" After all, there are certain similarities between both games. Find yourself stranded in the wilderness, mine ores and create some bland weapons and kill a generic boss and win.  But the similarities end exactly there.  Now, this game, in the starting phase, is actually quite bland, and I nearly quit because of it at first, but with the help of some friends, I stuck with it. It was pretty generic stuff. Mine some boring ores, build a boring house, feel the occasional rush of excitement of succesfully spelunking a cave and escaping unscathed with a new weapon, or dying and dropping your money. You'll die quite a bit as well, but don't let that discourage you. The moment I realized the exact depth of the game (and realized Iactually loved this game) was the moment my friends and I summoned what is to be considered the first boss, the Eye of Cthulu. The intensity of the battle, especially with our underprepared selves and crappy armor (hint: armor is your best friend!) made victory all the more satisfying. The adrenaline rushes as a boss attack leaves you at low health and your struggle to survive easily surpasses Minecraft in it's entertainment value. Yet I believed that was all the game had to offer, that one bit of awesomeness.  WRONG!  Excluding event bosses, there are over 14 different and unique bosses of Terraria, each with their own unique powers, and in Expert mode, their strength is vastly increased and each boss gains a lethal special attack, from the Eye of Cthulu's blinding fast rushes to the Skeletron's deadly skull spin. No two bosses are the same, nor can they be approached in the same way. Nearly every boss requires meticulous planning and building. But that's not all. because you know what's better than killing a boss?  Sweet, sweet loot.  Emerging victorious from a boss fight is definitely cause for celebration, but emerging victorious with a new weapon is even better. From shields that allow for bash-like charging, to a scarf that reduces damage by 17%, every boss kill is new and gratifying with the loot.  Now, about now is where you can pick your specialization, especially if you're playing with friends. Will you be the hulking tank, absorbing all of the damage to protect your teammates? Or the looming mage, casting deadly spells from behind, or an archer, raining down death from above? It doesn't matter. After all, in Terraria, you're free to do what you want.  And right when you think things are getting bland again, hardmode hits you. All of your weapons and armor's effectiveness is quartered. Enemies are a challenge again. Venturing out at night is a near death sentence. New enemies will spawn, and new loot along with it. But again, don't be discouraged. You'll die quite a bit, after all. Build your strength up again, and go kick some ass.",440.3,Recommended,"135 people found this review helpful

The complexity, depth, and sheer magnitude of this game blows my mind every time I play it. There isn't a story, but there is clearly lore to uncover. You'll mostly be mining, fighting, building, and testing your creativity with different combinations of weapons and movement systems. There are many different types of armor which allow you to move in many different ways, which allows you to enhance your combat abilities against different enemies and just traverse the land / explore more easily. There are 83 different wearable movement items, to be exact....  Just kidding, that's JUST THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WINGS. AND WINGS AREN'T EVEN THE ONLY ITEMS THAT ENABLE YOU TO FLY.  There's rocket boots, hoverboards, rideable animals, space ships... Magical staffs, bows, swords, axes, rifles, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ machine guns, etc. The list of movement & combat items goes on forever, There are SO many different enemies, interesting bosses, and ways to fight them.

If you're not one of those people, buy this game.  I was confused when I first played, so here's my TLDR run-down of the game if you don't understand what the goal is (Assuming you're starting in a new world with a fresh character): Start with a few basic tools, build yourself a house (preferably multiple houses) which, once certain requirements are met, NPCs will move into. These NPCs will offer you different benefits and sell you interesting items, some of which are exclusive to them. The bosses in the world can either be summoned with different items, or will spawn in front of you once certain requirements are met. You want to beat the bosses for mainly 2 reasons: They drop amazing items, and/or they allow you to get certain new NPCs to move into your house. For example, defeating the Queen Bee will cause the Witch Doctor NPC to move into your house, who will sell you a great pair of Wings when you put him in a Jungle biome at night (yes, the Wiki is your best friend). So the goal of the game is to keep getting better metals/materials to make yourself better weapons/armor so you can beat stronger enemies/bosses so you can keep getting better metals/materials and so on. Once you beat the Wall of Flesh boss (which you have to summon in the Underworld by throwing a Voodoo Doll into a pit of lava), your entire world - including most enemies and metal ores - will change to Hardmode, and you'll pretty much feel like you're starting over again because enemies will once again be able to kick your ass and more bosses will become available to fight and more items will become available to craft.  That's just the surface level of the game, but that's the best general explanation I can give for people who are still like ""wtf is this game, what is my goal, what do I do"" because that's how I felt when I first played.  If you want a great explanation of why I love this game in video format, check out ""Terraria - Best video game ever made"" on YouTube by Maj0rLee. I'm not affiliated with him, it's just a great video about the game if you're still on the fence.   P.S. If you think this game looks appealing to you but you're more interested in a more linear, story-driven experience, check out Starbound. It's also really good, and is similar in its scope/style.",261.4,Recommended,"138 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-02-14 00:00:00,"After finally attaining the last achievement for Terraria I can say that I feel almost prepared to write a meh review.  Terraria on the surface level seems pretty simple.. right? A charming pixel game with linear-ish progression and an open world sandbox... is what I would say if it weren't for the crafting in this game. The game doesn't slack off when it comes to crafting so if you haven't purchased a second monitor to play Terraria on than go and buy one, it's kind of essential due to the fact you will have the wiki open 99% of the time.  Terraria features items in the thousands and everything will craft into something else eventually, the amount of stuff the dev's have put into their small little indie game is simply insane and should keep you busy for a few hours ;). The bosses in Terraria are all beautifully designed and actually manage to have a thread of lore linking them together, which is surprising for a sandbox game like Terraria. Once you are done with the bosses though there is literally unlimited possibilities for expanding and designing your world, with the addition of Journey mode this becomes even easier aswell.  Lastly before the review ends I thought it might be prudent to mention the fact that Terraria has kept its price near-consistent the entire time that it's been released with a slight price bump towards it's final update. Regardless of this, the amount of content you get for the price is simply tremendous and this is coupled with the fact that Terraria is almost always on some sort of sale, there's no reason to not have it really.",638.0,Recommended,"163 people found this review helpful

105600,2017-10-23 00:00:00,"Huge amount of content, procedurally generated worlds, quite a few choices in playstyles for characters in the late game when you get kit that provides specific bonuses to damage types, lots of bosses, lots of mobs, lots of buffs/debuffs, quite a few techniques to master, a good feel of progression across hours of play, active development (after a long hiatus in the middle), and a good community. Building/crafting is intuitive and fast albeit 2d, and the game makes for a very fun co-op experience if you have friends to play with.  At its price bracket, the value for time spent is phenomenal if you like the idea of a 2d sandbox platformer with boss fights and the excitement of the next loot drop. Difficulty scales nicely (and has an ""expert"" mode for those that find the default game a bit easy), World size is variable, and the penalty on dying can be chosen from ""drop some money and nothing else"" to ""your character is dead, please start again"".  One of the nicest features of Terraria is the ability to have characters and worlds that aren't tied to each other. So if you're looking for a specific item that doesn't seem to be on your world, you can just generate a new one, take your character there to farm for items, and then go back to your main world - or you can start a brand new character on a world you've already built up with NPCs and everything else rather than needing to completely start from scratch each time - not many games have managed to pull this off so well.  The game is also very kid friendly, and has been a fun family multiplayer game in this house many times over.  Summary  Excellent 2D platformer with crafting, boss fights, huge amounts of content from aesthetics to rare items and godly weapons, the ability to continually improve your character over hours of play, and well designed procedurally generated levels. Great single player experience, great multiplayer experience as long as you have other friends or family members to play with. Very cheap for the amount of content and game there is available.",669.1,Recommended,"105 people found this review helpful

105600,2024-06-21 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Terraria is the best game in its genre. Don't believe me? Now I will PROVE it to you. 1. You become more reserved and patient. After all, when you lose to Moonlord for the tenth time, you really want to drill a hole in the monitor, don’t you? However, after a couple of worlds in the master mode, you begin to understand reality and accept this harsh life as it is. 2. You begin to better navigate Wikipedia, because remembering recipes for more than FIVE THOUSAND is not so easy, right? But in addition to items, you will have to look for how to summon bosses, how to kill them, how to move NPCs into your home, how to buy the pylon you need, how to repay a loan, how to get a girlfriend, how to support your family with your last cents.... oh, That's not what I was talking about. 3. You don't need a high resolution monitor. Pixel games are cool. 4. Do you really need any more reasons to download this masterpiece game?  I'll be honest, for the first ten hours of the game you will be plagued by paranoia and increased temper. It will pass soon, don't worry. After the rehabilitation period in a mental hospital, you will feel that same feeling of peace and tranquility.  10/10 Broken Zeniths  P. S.

There is hundreds of hours worth of gameplay without modding nowadays and then there is the multiplayer servers, which add another level of fun to the game.  You can setup your own private server through the game to play with friends, or download a server to setup so you can use commands.  You can mod the game using TModloader and then the possibilities are endless, make your own mod, or download one!  like i said, i think everyone should have this game and i reccomend it for everyone, to solo and multiplayer people.","1,731.2",Recommended,"117 people found this review helpful

105600,2016-08-08 00:00:00,"Probably best 2D sandbox ever made. The amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat (including bosses) is just sometimes overwhelming.  The game has 2 stages :  1) Pre-hardmode - basically a longer ""tutorial"" where you learn basics such as crafting, fighting monsters and exploring biomes, this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh.  2) Hardmode - the real game begins here, monsters are stronger and new biomes appear, a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode. This stage remains forever (or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it).  There are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders won't be dissapointed though I was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building.

105600,2017-09-24 00:00:00,"Overall : 9/10 A friend recommended this game, but I was hesitant to buy it at first. It looked like a minecraft ripoff in a 2D world. The large amount of positive reviews and the low prive (4.99 euro at that time) convinced me to give this a try.  I could not have been more wrong. This game is awesome ! The amount of content, the freedom, the difficulty level, the items and achievements you can collect, all of this make it one of the best games I have ever played.  You can: 1 Create large buildings 2 Collect loads of items, weapons and armor 3 Explore a huge map 4 Become a badass warrior and defeat enormous bosses 5 ...  One thing I really like is what changes if you play on the highest difficulty level. Ofcours everything gets a lot harder, but you are also able to get better and more drops (items) from enemies. This feels like the game is rewarding you for playing on a higher difficulty.  There is even a multiplayer aspect, which makes it even better. It is really fun to play with friends.  Graphics : 8/10 Not too impressive, a 2D world map. The graphics itself are outdated but create the perfect atmosphere for this game. You can create 2 types of worlds, which each have a different dark environment. Multiple biomes (forest, jungle, desert, ...) exist, with its own unique enemies and environment.  Optimization : 9/10 Good optimization, 60 fps on 1440p-max on a gtx 980 (overclocked) with v-sync on. Without v-sync, the fps went up to a stable 165 fps, but for some reason playing on 60 fps is more enjoyable.  Story : 2/10 This is where the game is lacking at the moment. Actually no story exists, you are free to create your own :)  Length : 10/10 I killed the final boss after 125 hours on the highest difficulty. This is awesome for a game where I payed 4.99 for. The game is not finished though. I can still perfect my house, kill other bosses, collect items, explore some more...  I have around 180 games in my steam library, after 2 weeks this game is in the top 3 of most played games. Enough said.  Replayablity : 10/10 Each world you create, is unique because they are created based upon a ""seed"". As stated above, each world has its unique dark environment. The type is selected upon world creation. There are different type of ores, but each world will only contain . This means each world will play differently and you need to create a lot of worlds to be able to collect all the items in the game.  Because of this you will never be able to see al the content and achievements on your first playthrough.  Update : They are still updating the game :)",208.1,Recommended,"86 people found this review helpful

105600,2016-04-14 00:00:00,"AT A GLANCE (Full review follows below)  Game Name: Terraria Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Open-world; 2D; Sandbox; Survival; Multiplayer My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Sandbox players; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEW is already a well-known game. There probably isn’t much I can say which hasn’t already been said. Many gamers have heard of it, and many gamers know it is considered to be generally “great,” transcending most genre preferences and prejudices. And I now count myself among those people. But the inherent quality of isn’t necessarily that obvious when a total newcomer decides to give it a shot, as the game can be quite uninviting at first. And that is something I want to address.  So I will tell you, like the thousands of others, that is an incredibly enjoyable game. It is hard to concisely describe exactly it is so enjoyable; but it basically boils down to the fact that there is an air of quality inherent to every gameplay aspect and those aspects synergize so well that that quality is multiplied exponentially in the end result.  But when I first decided to try it, I failed three times to get into it. Each time I sat down and tried to see what all the fuss was about, but each time I wound up extremely bored and confused as to why I couldn’t see what was supposed to be so fun about it. The lack of any clear purpose and direction at the start of the game had me running around with no real incentives, and it ended up feeling unrewarding. Then I played with some new friends online who could offer a bit of direction. We started a new world together and the next thing I knew hours had flown by and I realized that I was finally enlightened.  It was difficult to get over the initial hump of a learning curve and having a starter character. There is no tutorial, there are no objectives; simply moving around is tedious at first, the digging is slow, and the building options are minimal… and it can all feel rather boring. But when you finally start making progress into the game, all the upgrades and item-tiers you climb through feel so gratifying. And I think having that initial slow-climbing grind at the start is a major part of what makes the game so satisfying once you finally delve into the heart of it.  Once you reach this point of enlightenment, you will be eager to explore all that has to offer. Hunt down exotic loot. Fight epic boss battles. Build giant castles with thousands of items. Make new friends and enjoy the enormous replayability of playing online. Maybe even try a role-play server. There are many hours of fun to be had.  Perhaps the only negative aspects worth noting are the simplistic graphics and the lack of any clear story-mode. But due to the great gameplay and nature of the game, both of these things are easily dismissed as a non-issue by most. That said, if you really like story-driven experiences and/or gorgeous, current-gen graphics, you definitely won’t find those here.  So in short, is something that can be easily enjoyed by almost any gamer. If you haven’t yet given it a go, you should probably consider it. It is a pretty safe bet for all but the most extremely discerning gamers. Just don’t forget that it may feel boring at first, but it is worth fighting past it; and playing with some people online can make it significantly more fun, especially when you are new.",48.7,Recommended,"150 people found this review helpful

105600,2015-12-20 00:00:00,"Terraria, the best sandbox game on Steam. Well, that is obviously my opinion and to me, it holds true. The first thing you should realise about Terraria is that there is no real ""story"" to the game. Besides collecting resources, building a base and most of battling the fierce monsters that Terraria has to offer. And oh BOY does it have monsters. I think the best place to start this review would be talking about what I love about the game and what I sometimes wish was worked on a little bit.  Firstly, what I really love about this game is the sense of accomplishment. And I don't mean accomplishment as in ""congrats, you killed a single enemy here's 100 great items and 20 achievements"". I mean accomplishment as in you fight your hardest and kill a boss which you've been grinding for (will expand on this point later), which gives you a good item. Now, once again, when I say a good item I in no way mean game winning or game breaking items. I mean items that should carry you through until the next boss and the cycle continues.  Now, as I said earlier about grinding. Yes, this game does have grinding in it. However I deem it necessary to explain how grinding i this game differs to grinding in an RPG. First and foremost, yes this game will require a bit of grinding just to get something new and helpful in your quest. However you must not worry. If you choose to grind alot, which I know most people will choose to do, you will get better gear. However if you just run in and collect all ores that you see and kill everything that wants to do harm towards you, you'll still get good stuff; stuff that will help you defeat the next boss. So, to sum that up let me put it like this; This game doesn't require you to grind, just to dig and collect everything that you need for that next big battle.  Speaking of bosses, this game has multiple (14, to be exact!), all of which are unique. I'm going to talk about 3 of the main bosses that you'll be seeing early on in the game. Those 3 bosses are Eye of Cthulu, The Eater of Worlds (The Brain of Cthulu on Crimson worlds!) and Skeletron. Each of these bosses are VERY unique. Now, whilst I don't want to spoil these bosses, I think the best way to describe them is like this: - Eye of Cthulu is a giant eye boss which charges you down and enters rage mode after a certain amount of damage is dealt. - The Eater of Worlds is a giant worm which will home in on you as you destroys it's segments, each dropping loot. - The Brain of Cthulu is a giant brain (suprisingly!). It spawns eyes which have to be defeated before attacking the actual brain itself. - And finally, Skeletron. Skeletron is a monstrous skeleton, with 2 hands which can be destroyed to make the fight easier. What I really love about these bosses is how different they all are from each other. End game bosses are equally amazing, but may require a giant WALL to be passed. Could cause a lot of FLESH wounds, if you catch my drift. End/Hardmode bosses are amazingly well done and should honestly is one of the most well done things in this game.  Enough about the bosses, let's talk about weaponry. There's a multitude of weapon TYPES to choose from. Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. And the amount of weapons within each catagory is well.. It's insane to be quite honest with you. If you're not enjoy swords, why don't you switch up to a staff which spews magical balls of damage to your foes? This game has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and with that you also get the different armour types to help you. Once again, armour comes in a multitude range; Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. Now, some people may not exactly understand what the classes are so let me help you understand what they are. - Melee is predominantly swords and some other weapons like maces and things like that - Ranged is mostly bows, guns and all the things like that. - Mage is staffs, books of magic and guff like that. - Now summoner, is where people probably don't understand what it is. Summoner allows you to summon minions to help you fight, like Slimes, Ravens and Pygmys.  Finally, where this game kinda falls short. I mean, it's nothing 100% game ruining. Achievements. OKAY, OKAY, LOWER THE PITCHFORKS, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF! I love the achievements in this game, they're fun, rewarding and allow me to play a different way in the game. But some of them are just so damn grindy. I mean, I think if you've played this game you understand where I'm going with this; the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Angler missons. I don't want to spend my time fishing when I could be fighting badass bosses and having a ball of a time. I don't want to fish. It's not as if it's just 5 or 10 times. It's 250 times. I don't want to fish for that long.  Look, this game is damn near perfect and there's no way I can deny that. The constant work the devs put in is astounding and I must say that it's amazing the time and dedication they put into it. And, well, it paid off. This review is simply a slither of what the game is. And with that, I bid you all goodbye and farewell. I hope you have an amazing day or night dependant on your timezone!",134.8,Recommended,"136 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-07-25 00:00:00,"Great great game!! I bought the 4-pack just over 5 dollars for me & my friends (totally worth it)!!! Would like to give a quick summary/review about terraria so here it goes. The Terraria's core structure So You have to create a character, and enter a randomly-generated world (small/medium/large). There's a day/night cycle, which means you'll immediately be under siege by zombies and floating eyeballs as soon as the sun goes down, so your first order of business is to put your starting set of copper harvesting tools to work and construct a house (complete with a table, chair, and light source so the guide npc can enter). Once you have a place to keep you safe at night, the world is pretty much your oyster. You run across the earth's crust to find some entry points into the vast network of underground caverns below your feet. You'll have to mine, chop, kill zombies, and return home with some iron, tin, and buckets of loot sourced from wooden, golden and variety of other chests as well as from the materials from enemy, you will need that for crafting the accessories later. You have to construct layered workstations to forge your harvest into better weapons and gear(crafting is fun), you'll have to build more houses that will attract new NPCs, who will sell you exotic items or offer fresh haircuts and many more other accessories and stuff, you'll eventually no longer have to fear the night, and will cut through zombies like cotton candy. After all that done you can fight bosses do events, fishing quests and other things like explore shrines, making themed houses for npcs and the list goes on. The fact that there are over a thousand items in total is insane!  Btw anyone who's getting started with terraria I suggest you to check the official terraria wiki, everything you need to know about weapon crafting, accessories, class setups, events, bosses, biomes, guides, npcs, every single thing you will get to know there! I'll attach the link below if somebody is interested!   lastly, I highly recommend everyone should give it a try once, the ton of content which you are getting under 5 dollars is insane!",236.5,Recommended,81 people found this review helpful 6

I assure you, it's nothing like it.  In Terraria, you are the player. A custom created character that has the sole goal of defeating the final boss and restoring the world to peace. Not to say that the game doesn't have it's fair share of building, aswell.  The combat is sort of simple, yet charming. I always love going on expert mode with my end-game character and fighting a bunch of bosses. It's always good fun. And while I may not be the best at building, I enjoy it too.  Terraria has to be my favorite game of all-time. Period. Just throw 10$ USD at the screen to get it, seriously. It's dirt cheap.  What? You already own the game?

105600,2017-12-07 00:00:00,"Terraria is a deceivingly complex game about gathering resources, fighting monsters, and getting that sick loot.  Terraria is a 2D sandbox game that allows you to gather resources and shape the world to your heart's content (excluding the dungeon, don't touch that place I swear, Dungeon Guardian flashbacks.) You start off with only a few basic tools and a guide to help you, and you're set off on your own. Throughout the game, you'll be doing a combination of building, destroying, exploring, crafting, looting, fighting, and dying. OK, mainly just dying.  At first, weak and lonely, you'll struggle to survive, dying to single zombies, fall damage, and those cursed pressure plates. You'll be desperate to grab every last block you can, in an attempt to seal in the cave that will become your tomb against the monsters outside. Every last piece of gear, from your weapons to your potions, will be treasured possessions that you've earned from blood, sweat, and tears (but will probably just be randomly thrown into your chests anyway, and then you'll end up losing track of everything and make 50 chests for only 10 chests' worth of items because you're disorganized, in addition to making the same item 15 times because you ""couldn't find it in your chest."" Yeah right.)  However, over time, you'll become more and more powerful and experienced, and by endgame you'll be thinking, ""I'm too good for this game."" At least, until you restart. And then your self-esteem level will drop to zero again. But don't worry, because no matter what stage of the game you're at, you won't be able to put it down.   Terraria is organized in perfect little boxes, which can be destroyed, placed, or interacted with. This can range from dirt to magma to the almighty lizhard brick. You can build whatever your heart desires, as long as you've got the material to do it (a shelter or base is the most obvious structure to build.) However, they aren't just for show; a good portion of the blocks have some sort of function or unique aspect to them (sand is affected by gravity, hellstone bricks burn you, and crimson blocks spread crimson.) You can also use the environment to your advantage in other ways; prevent mobs from reaching you with a pitfall, lava trap, or even just by building a skybase. If you like to decorate and make your house seem nice and cosy, they've got a plethora of decorative blocks and interactables; couches, dressers, chandeliers, etc. If you're more into exploration, then you'll find it hard not to enjoy Terraria. Every world is randomly generated, providing a playground for discovery. Different biomes, caves, and sky islands await the exploration they deserve. And, while the 2D world does seem like a limitation, it actually makes it much easier to build and explore overall, and it also provides the player a more clear sense of direction.   You will face many completely different eneimes on your path to godhood, and some may even kill you. I know, tough to hear when you're so used to being at video games. In order to protect your honor and your pocket change, you'll have the option the fight using any combination of weapons you desire. The main weapons types are melee, ranged, magic, and summoning. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages, and there are around 300 weapons in total. A good majority of these are also split into subcategories, and they all act differently. Although not all are, a majority of the weapons are unique and original; a sword that summons pumpkins, a bow that summons arrows from the sky, a crystal-shooting magic tome, etc. So, no, you will probably not be unable to find a weapon that suits you.  In addition to weapons, you've got your armors. Most armors correspond to a class type, and provide a unique and interesting buff when wearing the full set. They drastically change the way you play, and can turn a weakling into a sword into a weakling with a sword but with an inch of iron around him on all sides (yeah, unfortunately it doesn't change your skill. Darn.)  As for the actual combat, it can range from epic, 8 minute, one on one boss fights to just mindless horde-slaying. Using melee usually involves a lot of tanking and spamming left mouse, ranged usually involves aiming and dodging, and mage involves mana management and dodging. Overall, however, it involves a lot of skill and getting used to the enemies. The enemies are all extremely different and require different strategies to dodge (they are by far the most varied aspect of anything in the game, including the weapons blocks.) The bosses are all very intimidating and tough compared to other enemies, taking hundreds of hits and going through complex phases and attacks. Fighting and beating a boss can be done the first time, but for new players it usually takes a couple of tries to figure out the attack pattern and best strategy. Beating a boss provides a pathway to the next stage of the game, and you will finally feel complete for once in your life, even if for only a few moments.   Honestly, the soundtrack is alright. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. It definitely fits the game however, in the sense that you think ""cave!"" when you hear a certain track play. Overall, it does what it needs to do.   Terraria isn't like a ""proper"" RPG in the sense that you run around doing quests, but it definitely does have some of the RPG genre in it. For starters, it has a staggering amount of items. It also includes weapon modifiers, adding a variety of randomness to your gear, and accessories that provide cool abilities, such as rocket boots for flight or a shield to resist knockback. You can also recruit NPCs into your home, who will sell you various pieces of gear and equipment. They've even got pets and companions that follow you around.   You play through all of Terraria with multiple friends, and progress together through the world. While this is very fun, there are some serious issues with it as well. For one, many of the resources, even in a large world, become very limited once multiple people begin to join. Balance is also offset, to the point where Moon Lord can be be beaten first try by a bunch of people with no real preparation, as long as you can respawn fast enough. This isn't really a fault of Terraria itself, more of just a consequence that happens as a result. With a few people, it's not really a big issue; however, as you try to load more players onto a server, it becomes apparent Terraria wasn't made for it. All in all though, I've played the multiplayer with friends on multiple occassions and it was a blast. Just make sure you trust them.   Terraria has a bunch of additional features that may not seem major, but provide extra content when added up. Wiring is a major one that I personally enjoy; create complex automated trap systems, entrances, and even automated water-pumping systems. Fishing can be done using a fishing pole and bait; simply cast and wait for the bobber to jump. Hit it and hope you grab something good!   Terraria is a great game, probably one of my favorites. The progression and sandbox aspect make it fun to come back to after long breaks, or even after subsequent runs. The multiplayer is a blast too, but could use a little bit of tweaking in some areas. For $10 normally and around $5 on sale, it's a total steal. While not constant, updates freshen it up every once in a while so that you have to come back. To some people, it may lose its charm after the initial playthrough, but I keep on coming back to it. So, overall, yeah, I'd recommend this to anyone willing to try it.",332.4,Recommended,"84 people found this review helpful

105600,2017-07-15 00:00:00,"You are thrown into an open world without explanation, without instructions and without a goal, but trust me: soon enough you'll find out that you need to fight to survive, craft your own weapons and armors, build a house, lock the door and then spend hours deciding which wallpaper better matches the bathtub that you just looted from the dungeon.  Life can be hard in an open world such as the one from Terraria. You could be preparing a Bowl of Soup in your new kitchen when all of a sudden an army of Goblins invade from the West. And you were not geared! They might end up killing Isis, the Party Girl, and you kinda had a thing for her, but that's okay, that's just a game. She *will respawn*.  This game consists of exploring and exploring and exploring, and while you explore you'll find new enemies, new materials or ores to craft new accessories, gear, potions, vanity item, decorations for your house.  You can set up traps, build intricate mechanism and wiring (check around Terraria Teleporter Hub). You will face pretty challenging bosses, which will throw you in the search for more powerful gear to defeat him.  And after you done it all, you'll realize that Crimson Blocks are much cooler than the blocks you used to build your main Quarter in your Base. And you will rebuild it all again.  I've found the Multiplayer pretty cool, but for that you'd need to have friends who play at the same pace as you. It is not fun if one of you got much better gear than the others.  The achievements are right on spot, apart from the ""Supreme Helper Minion"" which befits the level of a trained monkey. Devs should learn that brainless repetition is hardly a challenge.

This game feels so open and with no objective, you can roam the world and choose what you focus on. Whether it’s improving your house or collecting every piece of armor. This game has a lot to offer and how this game has grown since release is insane and don’t get me started on mods. This game is worth every penny for how much gameplay you get out of this game. The graphics make the game look very childish and the colours but it’s very much grown up for how the game is played like fighting bosses and the gathering of materials, it can be grindy.  The game is about a player in a 2D pixelated world where the basis of the game is to fight monsters and bosses to get stronger. The progression to become more powerful throughout the game is very rewarding like hermes boots or wings, you appreciate the increased movement heavily and it becomes almost impossible to play without them once you become familiar.  I love this game and have spent a lot of time with friends which makes the game even better. The loot isn’t shared on multiplayer which is a bit awkward at times when loot is rare, sometimes people will be ahead based on the luck of chests but this can become easier when that person assists you on finding the same item. This game is enjoyable in single player but is always better with friends but the aim is to become strong enough to fight the wall of flesh. This game will constantly have you searching up items and crafting with the extensive amount of items in the game which adds to the playability. The game will grow on you as you play since the start up of the game is slow compared to the ending but it leaves for more invested time in your character. The satisfaction of having a armor set and upgrading defence or obtaining good items like horseshoe or cloud in a jar. These equipable items are very helpful and necessary at the start to climbing to higher and stronger enemies.  In conclusion, this game is very enjoyable but the world feels boring on a 2D environment. The startup for the game is slow especially when playing the game before. It is very rewarding if you play the game out and slowly upgrade, the fishing challenges is a nice touch to something different to fighting since the game is mostly killing and mining. I hate to say it but has a formula like minecraft but I feel this game has more content and the mods are insane.

105600,2019-08-03 00:00:00,"Terraria is on my list of greatest PC games I've ever played.  It's a sandbox, but the mechanics are intuitive.  The graphics are simple enough that you understand what's going on, but rich enough to have a great experience with them.  The soundtrack is chill, and makes for good background.  And most importantly, unlike a lot of other sandbox games, I never really feel like I've seen it ""all."" There's always more to explore, and I know if I feel like my world is played out, I can just roll up another one and see a dozen new things.  Highly, highly recommended.",488.6,Recommended,"106 people found this review helpful

105600,2019-02-16 00:00:00,"Definitely worth the money, and there are so many features and possibilities that you can play it for hundreds and thousands of hours without it getting boring. Hundreds of different blocks, weapons, items, cosmetics, accessories, enemies and 29 different bosses, with 14 events to fight against.  Gameplay is definitely a 10/10, with smooth controls, amazing items, neat accessories, building blocks, everything.  Replayability is also a 9.5/10, because you can make self-imposed challenges, such as ""Magic weapons only"" or ""No crafting."" Along with that, there are nearly endless possibilities as to what world you might get. There are so many unique worlds that you could play the game for years and still not get the same world twice.  Graphics are an 8.5/10, although everything is made in 16-bit design, the simple graphics still get the job done fairly well.  Community is about 9.5/10, there are so many amazing artists who draw fanart, so many amazing youtubers who make such great videos, and so many great players who have all chipped in to make this game what it is today.  Computer requirements are close to nothing. I can play this game on a nintendo switch and still have room for Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey on there.  Hope this review was helpful, and remember that this game is well worth your money.  Edit 1: There is also plenty of opportunity for modding the game with several hundreds of different mods, some high quality (Calamity, Thorium, Overhaul, etc.) and some... not so good. although modding can only be run on PC as far as I know, it's definitely worth the time to check it out! TModLoader link here (TModLoader is what's used to run the mods in the first place):  Edit 2: Even after pouring nearly 5,000 more hours into this game, i still don't get tired of it. Between the mods, the challenges, everything. This game has entertained me for years.  Edit 3: TModloader is now a separate game that you can download on steam, meaning that you don't have to go through the process of backing up your game, then manually putting the TModloader files into your terraria folder. lord knows i've had to do that a few times...            my only problem though is thOSE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WORMS","6,387.0",Recommended,"107 people found this review helpful

These are the only similarities: -They both have mining and exploration -They both have zombies to fight -They both have bosses -They both have Hell (an underworld)  That's all i can think of at the top of my head. Now, let me tell you about Terraria's advantages: -It has 13 (I think) bosses, unlike Minecraft only has 3 (I think) -It has TONS and TONS of enemies -It has over 3,000 items and weopons -It has Heaven and Hell -It's caves are more fun to explore and easier to find  Now, Terraria isn't all good, in some peoples eyes, in someways like: -It's 2D (I don't find it a problem) -It's too ""confusing"" or ""boring"" (again, I don't find it confusing nor boring) -It's a ""copy of Minecraft"" (no it isn't btw) So, I hope you like my review and I encouraged you to buy it. *Add me if you need a partner for co-op gameplay* (NEW CHARACTERS)  EDIT by arachnid14 1. terraria has over 3900 items 2. they both have some form of electricity/circuit building 3. both are blocks (duh) 4. terraria is cheaper to buy and goes on sale occasionally 5. 2D is good since minecraft is already doing 3D and it would be kinda boring for the games to look so much alike 6.terraria has like 12 pets 7. minecraft has a useful pet 8. terraria makes light come from you when your holding a torch",759.9,Recommended,"466 people found this review helpful

105600,2013-12-02 00:00:00,"Being a Minecraft fan, I looked down upon the infamous Terraria for quite a long time, deemed its existence as a small nuisance. What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the ""crafting"" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.  However, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).  The amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!  There is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!  Also, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).  If you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years).",195.1,Recommended,478 people found this review helpful 0

It may just look like a ""2d Minecraft"" but it really is not. At first when i played this masterpiece, it felt so confusing and i had absolutely no idea what to do, I left this game for a few years and totally forgot about it until a friend had asked me if i had played this game called ""terraria"" I had said that I had played it before but never got to grips with it and gave it up and that was about it for the conversation. 2 days later my friend had came over to my house to just chill and he had asked me if i had tried terraria again, I said no and he asked if i still had it downloaded and I said I so we loaded it up and he had shown me how to play (controls, basic knowlodge ect.) and we had a great night he sat in a chair next to me and basicially just showed me the ropes . Around 5 hours went past and I had managed to just defeat the Queen Bee Boss. He had to go because it was getting late but he had told me a few good youtubers to watch to improve at the game. I was so hooked i would come home from whatever i was doing that day and would just want to play. Forward to present day and i have completed the game about 10 times i have played all classes on master mode and also completed the game on the hardest seed, I have also modded this game and honestly just improves the experience so much! I cannot express my love for this game enough and I reccomend that you just buy it and give it a go, It isnt expensive and I BET you will love it and never regret spending that small amount of money for honestly the best game in existance.

105600,2014-11-02 00:00:00,"Terraria is a sidescrolling sandbox rpg. The game uses procedurally generated maps to provide the player with a unique experience every time. While some say the game is a ripoff of Minecraft it is, imo, rather a testement to what Minecraft could have been. The game uses a sidescrolling pixelated style and focuses on the standard rpg fare of collecting items and then using them to explore locations and fight bosses to collect more items. The game focuses less on the creation aspect of sandbox rpg and moreso on the rpg part while Minecraft does the opposite.  While the game has a variety of cosmetics and various building materials that simply isn't the point of the game. The point of the game is fighting the boss, progressing to the next level, and getting to, and beating, the inevitable hard mode. This focus does mean that the game eventually, like all rpgs, dims out and you will find yourself unable to progress and not so willing to farm for rare items. It is an issue experienced by even MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Terraria sadly does not come out with enough large updates (Expansions if you wil) to warrent continous playing from update to update. The bosses are varied and the enemies are fun to fight, the caves are fun to explore etc. Everything you would want from a sandbox rpg game but unlike Minecraft's seamingly endless tracks of land you can easily explore the entirety of your Terraria world. This is sad as some things such as Pyramids, ice caves etc are not going to spawn on every world unlike in Minecraft where it is simply walking around trying to find the right biome. This issue is actually an odd one. As all the creativity in building a house could go to waste when you find there is not teh right biome you are looking for on this world. The act of having to world hop with your character is a poor one and while it is there for a reason the fact that there is a chance you will HAVE to do it is saddening and ruins a portion of the game and breaks imersion.  Another issue the game struggles with is online play. Unlike games such as Diablo where the enemies grow in strength the more players that are in a single game the mobs of Terraria do not care if as many as 8 people are in their world they will stay the same strength. This makes large parties of friends able to easily chew through a majority of the game undergeared as they may be. And while they require more resources to upgrade there are so many of them to fight and die to kill the boss that it does not neccessarily matter. This means that while playing alone can be incredibly difficult and require alot of pre-planning and execution with multiple people you just kind of gang-bang the boss until it stops moving and drops it's loot. The various classes (Magic, melee, ranged etc) are fairly balenced with Melee providing the most armor but doing the least damage in and so on in standard RPG fashion.  While the game does have issues it is still a great sandbox rpg that can provide hours of fun especially when played with a few friends so as to keep the game challenging. Defining your character, mineing and crafting your weapons and armor, building a small village for the npcs to live in all feels good and is fun to do either alone or with friends. I rate the game, in it's current state, a 8.3/10",184.6,Recommended,"379 people found this review helpful

105600,2022-04-23 00:00:00,"Terraria is an absolutely huge 50-175 hour 2D sandbox survival exploration with some rather fantastic biomes, boss fights, housing, furniture, weapons, and mounts – the survival mode is optional; as starting the game on Journey Mode gives you access to time & weather changes, enemy spawn rates, item duplication, and a godmode option you can turn on and off. Starting the game, you create a world, and you choose how large it can be, how difficult you want it, if you want the crimson or corruption, or random. After that, it’s all randomly generated with an ocean on each side, floating islands, a huge dungeon, perhaps some living trees that you can make some rather fantastic treehouses with, and of course, The Underworld. Beating bosses unlocks new content, new npcs, new weapons and mounts, more biomes, and some neat events. Much of the content is optional and I will freely admit most of my time was me building a large apartment complex that went into space; with some individual houses for my favorite npcs in their preferred environments.  While Terraria’s strong point isn’t the storyline, the sandbox aspect is honestly enough to let you roleplay your heart out and come up with your own conclusions. Between fighting off the occasional pirate invasion, flying around with rainbow wings, and occasionally fighting my favorite boss, The Empress of Light, I honestly had a fantastic time by myself without even touching the multiplayer option. Spending 100 hours in this game is easier than I expected, and it’s easy to recommend.  TL;DR – A 2D sandbox game that’s easy to sink 100 hours into, optional boss fights, a rather incredible amount of weapons and item customization, pets, mounts. Fight god, or fish the entire time. Multiplayer is optional. 50 -175 hours to complete.",101.3,Recommended,"115 people found this review helpful

The game is great once you get into it but I think the reason it is so underrated is because the beginning of the game is a bit lacking. People just start up a world, chop down a tree or die to a slime or something and get bored. With Terraria you have to be patient. The game is difficult and a bit unforgiving at times but with the sheer amount of places to explore and items to find I personally think it's an amazing game. The best part about the game in my opinion is the music. I unironically listen to Terraria music sometimes it's that good. Anyway, I'm gunna go play some Terraria now.

105600,2016-07-28 00:00:00,"What is Terraria? Terraria was a game that, often mistaken as a ""Minecraft clone"" and often seen as ""2D Minecraft"". Even after all that nonsense, Terraria was still a unique and a very young 2D adventure game that dragged many players into its world. After 1.2 update, Terraria became even larger, selling millions of copies, but then just after 1.2.1, it began to slowly die off. Fans were crying for it... Not until something wonderful happened. Terraria was released on consoles, slightly extending its life, and then, there were rumors about a big update for Terraria on PC. The 1.3 update was litteraly an explosion of new content, and yes, its true, +1000 items were added into game. This has to be one of the largest updates ever made for one game in gaming history. Free updates are still coming, adding more and more content, together with bug fixing and tweaking to make game more enjoyable and fun.  If isn't obvious by now, Terraria is much better than Minecraft in all aspects. Don't get me wrong, Minecraft and modding is a wonderful thing too, but Minecraft alone will be never as good as Terraria currently is. So, what does Terraira feature that makes it such a great game? Let's start from what you can do in Terraira:  FIGHT! From smacking slimes with your copper sword you start with, to annihilating the most powerful creatures of universe, you will learn (in a hard way) how dangerous the lands of Terraira really are. You are nowhere safe, not even inside your own home, as during certain events, swarms of enemies will break into your house, attempting to turn you and your fellow NPCs into a pile of mangled corpses. Hell, even bosses will come after you to punish your cowardness (if you haven't defeated them yet). Even if you own a good equipment to fend off enemies, your world is still in danger. There are biomes, seen as ""evil"", that will spread out and eventually corrupt your entire world. You are only one who can prevent this, so you better get a move on!  You will come across thousands of enemies, as well as thousands of weapons to use aganist them. There are so many weapons to choose from, that everytime you start from beggining, you will find different set of weapons and armor to use. This is what makes replayability in Terraria great. From weapons, you have: swords that are ten times larger than your character, swords that shoot swords, bow that makes arrows rain from sky, large variety of machineguns, launchers, pistols, laser weaponary, craziest magical items you'll ever see, lots and lots of ammo types, and much, much more... Once you got yourself a good gear, its time to challenge most powerful and badass bosses that you will have hard time defeating. Gain their loot, and progress deeper in world of Terraria, eventually unlocking the ""Hardmode"" in your world, where real adventure begins and where only real heroes (your characters) shall become champions of Terraria!  BUILD! Hundreds and hundreds of blocks to choose from, Terraira offers greatest choice of decorations and blocks for all creative minds out there! Most of blocks have their own theme (e.g. Marble represents acient Greeks), as well as their own set of furniture, such as bathtubs, tables, bookshelfs, lamps, etc. Some require for you to own special crafting stations and tools in order to use them for building, meaning that you will need to explore and fight in order to earn those items. Once you got everything you need, its up to you what you want to build. A house made entirely out of bones? Slime? Glass? Honey? Or make it steampunk themed, alien themed, have golden toilets, garden full of large glowing mushrooms, color ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blocks, beds made out of flesh... I can go forever like this, the options, are truly endless! You can even shape blocks with hammers and/or color them, build traps with wiring system, wall tappets, decorations, paintings... Remember, you world... Is your canvas! You can get NPCs to live inside your marvelious creations, and they will sell you many things that you will find very useful.  Oh, and also, you can craft single colored blocks with gems you find underground. These blocks are made for pixel art!  EXPLORE! A small world of Terraira contains everything you need, but just imagine what large worlds offers. All you have to do is explore them! You will find large variety of awesome loot, accesories and weapons for your character to use, statues to collect, and most importantly, ores used for crafting and crystal hearts that extend your maximum health. But beware, as I said, nowhere is safe. Underground is full of deadly traps and mobs that you are probably too weak to fight aganist, as well as other hazards such as water that you can easily drown in and lava that incrinates everything that touches.  If you have hard time exploring the underground, try fishing! With fishing, you a can get seriosuly good loot that can help you face the dangers of underground. All you need here is bait, good fishing rod, patience and with enough luck, you will be swinging fish-swords and shark-pickaxes at your foes!  COLLECT! Collecting virtual pixel sprites was never been so fun. Being able to own everything that exists in Terraria is satifaction at its best! If you like collecting stuff, you will probably relate to struggles of having filled up inventory with statues and paintings, hurrying back to your spawn so you can see what traveling merchant has for sale and defeating one boss over and over again, just to get that one item that you don't own, only to leave it inside a chest and never use it again. Or a throphy to decorate your walls with. Ah, lovely!  CUSTOMIZE! In order to customize your character in a way you really want, it needs a lot of effort. You will need to fight and explore a lot, as well as get NPCs to live with you so you can buy vanity items from them. Terraria also features ""social slots"". With these slots, you can wear both armor and vanity clothes without losing defense points that armor gives. In-case you find one armor likeable, but you don't want to wear it because you already own a better armor, just put it in social slot and you will look like you are wearing it, and your actual, better armor, will still provide you its perks and abilities. Social slots are made for cosmetic purposes. You can also use dyes to paint yourself and your vanity and armor in different colors, as well as using hair dyes for hair. There's an impressive amount of dye combinations that you can craft, as well as rare dyes that glow, have animations, reflect light and other kinds of wacky colors and effects.  Should you buy this game? Why, of course! Its worth every single copper coin. And has multiplayer too, which makes plenty hours of fun if you have a buddy/buddies to play with. It has holiday events during halloween and christmass, where you can get rad loot if you play during those special events.  I gurantee this game will bring you at least thousand hours of fun, as long as you prove yourself worthy and prevail over frustation and dangers that Terraria can offer. Well, will you?",798.4,Recommended,"112 people found this review helpful

With the amount of NPCs, bosses, biomes, exploration, classes, etc you'll never get bored.   With each class, comes a different path with different materials and different ( optional ) bosses that you fight to get stronger equipments. With each boss comes a different style of fighting and a different environment, either you fight in the middle of a jungle cave, or in a dungeon, or an underworld filled with lava, or get a random event like pirate invasion.

It's a thrilling sandbox adventure with mostly linear progression, tons of content, and lots of replayability. They keep updating it every once in a while, and content-focused mods can elevate the experience even more.

105600,2016-07-20 00:00:00,"Introduction: Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with elements of action, mystery and adventure set in a beautifully pixelated world of flying eyeballs and various biomes like hell. With the choice to build, mine, fish, explore, fight and ride unicorns, how you play the game is really up to you.  Pros: -Customisable characters with cloud support. -Dozens of weapons, armour, equipment, tools and consumables to choose from. -Various mounts and pets to choose from. -Multiple biomes with their own unique inhabitants, resource and behaviour. -Over ten bosses that provide a challenge for combat lovers. -Interesting NPCs who appreciate your horrible houses. -More than one way to play the game (such as fishing, mining and dying). -Hundreds of craft-able items and dozens of blocks.   -Very time-consuming (although some see this as a good thing).   Terraria is not a rip-off of Minecraft, but is actually a phenomenal game packed with fun and a lot of content. It is definitely worth its price and twice the fun when played with a friend. Even after beating the final boss, there are still lots to explore, discover and achieve in this wonderfully made game.

105600,2016-09-21 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Alright, this game is probably one of the best games that i have ever played. At first, when my friend was talking about a 2D game that was kinda like minecraft where you could build whatever you wanted and fight monsters at night, i was thinking that you might aswell go play minecraft. But my friend constantly bugged me saying that this is a must play game. After about 2 months of harrasment a sale happend that brought this game down to two bucks.  Once that happend within 30 seconds of the sale my friend had bought a copy of the game for me. As you can see from the amount of hours i have on this game it wasn't for nothing. We have ""beaten"" the game about 5 times, first on softcore easy world (at this point there wasn't any hard world option) then we tried to only stick two one class throught a whole playthrough getting to the end (at this point the end was Duke Fishron) after a couple months of not playing the game we came back and found that there was a massive update to the game and a Boss called the Moonlord was a thing. At this point there wasn't any knowlage of the moonlord, like how to spawn him, how hard he is, what he drops. We kept it a mystery until we would eventually kill him ourselves.  We started an easy world with softcore characters and started on a journey that brought back memories. Once we had killed the Eye of Cthulu, and as usual my friend and i fought over who got the loot from him, we had heard some talk about a new game mode called Hardmode. So we packed up all our stuff and moved onto a hardmode world. Now that slimes could basically two hit us ♥♥♥♥ started to get heated. With multiple cases of raging to trying to get our money that we had lost back, to basically anything that wasnt planned jumping right on our asses. After a very long month or so of playing about 5 times a week we had seen these wierd looking ""Cultists"" at our doungeon. Seeing as we don't like people just taking over them we tried to kill them, thus resulting on an epic battle of things flying everywhere and the lead cultist splitting into aobut 20 different holograms of himself we realized that this fright wasn't even a challenge. Once he was dead a weird looking orange sun poped up in the background, it took about five seconds of us admiring the ""moon set"" until a massive fire worm came and one shot both of us. After many trial and errors trying to defeat the different colours that we still didn't understand we had killed the last pillar that led to the fastest death you could imagine.  Now that the last pillar had been taken down, we set our in search of the one thing that would spawn the moon lord that we had been hearing so much about. Once we saw the words on our screen and seeing it getting all fuzzy we were wondering what was going on until we saw a massive moon looking man come and one shot both of us with a huge lazer that decimated everything that it touched. After all that time and enerygy we realized that we could craft some pretty decent stuff from the little sould that the pillars dropped. Now equipping some of the best gear in the game we had rtied about 4 more times with the pillars and finally defeated the moon lord. Once all of that was done we had taked a much longer break. Now we have stared to play again and this time we are playing medium core characters.  Just some advice, if you have even made it this far in my journey of Terraria, dont try and play a medium core for your first character. you will not play this game again. ill try and finish the mediumcore play through and then maybe evern a hardcore one.

The dungeons you'll skulk through continue to present new challenges and new enemies the lower you go, and while the pure act of digging can get a little grindy at times, there's a wonderful splendor to dipping your toes into an uncharted grotto, thousands of miles below sea level, that will never get old. Terraria can truly be whatever you make of it. You can download a checklist that will fast-track you through all the optimal crafting paths or boss strategies. Or you can simply get lost in the transcendental meditation of digging, and finding cool stuff, and doing more digging. Kill the brain of C'Thulu with a revolver, or find a nice bookcase and proudly mount it on the second floor of your apartment.

I actually sort of enjoy doing it, but others might not.) ☐ Frustrating ☐ Sleepy ☐ Boring ☑ Fun ☑ Challenging  ۞ Game time / Length ۞ ☐ Really short (0 - 3 hours) ☐ Short (4 - 8 hours) ☐ Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story] ☐ Long (40-60 hours) [if you complete everything] ☐ Very Long (61-100 hours) ☑ Extremely Long (101+ hours) (Still haven't entered hard mode, taking my time and enjoying everything the game has to offer. This does not even involve mods.)  $ Price / Quality $ ☑ Full price ☐ Wait for Sale ☐ Don't buy ☐ Refund it if you can  FINAL WORDS Overall, one of the best games I've played. You can really tell how much love and effort has been put into this game, and it really shows how you do not need to be a triple A ultra realistic game to shine. Can not recommend this game enough!

Its a versatile game too, meaning it can be chill or challenging, depending on what you feel like doing, what difficulty you play on and how you approach the game. The possibilities are nearly endless.  I personally, tried this game a while back, enjoyed it but wasn't too enthusiastic about it due to how overwhelming it can be for a complete noob. A few months later and I picked it up again, started a new character and a new world and now I can't stop. My only regret is not having played this game sooner, when I had more time.

105600,2018-06-09 00:00:00,"Terraria looks like your typical sandbox crafting game. And it might've been that in the early patches. But after the Hardmode update everything changed. In my opinion that's when Terraria became its own game. It feels like an RPG, with rare loot, bosses and classes, but with a twist which would be the crafting and base-building. It's way more complex than it looks, and at the same time it's really accessible. You can play it very casually or go deeper (for example checking wiki for droprates on X item, best prefixes for weapon, mechanics on world spawning, etc).  It has everything you need for a great adventure game, tons of items, weapons and enemies, and unique bosses with different AIs. And if you think the game is too easy there's Expert mode (which in my opinion, it's the way the game is meant to be experienced). Hardcore runs are also a thing but keep in mind it's really hard to play with no deaths (looking at you boulder traps). You finished the game and want more content? Worry not, there's Mod support (really easy to get into, just search tModloader on google and after you install it there's a mod browser in game). Finally, multiplayer mode. Terraria is a great solo game but even better multiplayer. Since there's multiple classes, you can make a party with your friends and share items that don't fit your class, explore together, farm bosses, etc.  Overall, Terraria is a great sandbox adventure game, with a lot of replayability, specially with mods (Calamity, Thorium and Fargo's are my personal favorites). The game is still being updated to this day (currently June 2018) which show the devs really care about their game. The only con I can think about is that the early game is kinda slow. Takes a while to get going. I personally don't feel it but I heard complaints about it. Really recommend it 10/10 game.","1,850.1",Recommended,"86 people found this review helpful

105600,2019-02-28 00:00:00,"Product received for free  So much more than a 2D Minecraft Clone.  Terraria is a sandbox-survival adventure game. It feature the classic collect materials and build stuff gameplay. But instead of a 3D environment it has a 2D perspective. Released in 2011, Terraria is one of Re-Logic most successful game with millions of copies sold and many different ports onto a various selection of gaming platforms. Personality I love the game most since it features gameplay I enjoy, mine material, make weapons and armor, and take down evil forces.  Gameplay in Terraria is a pretty standard by now. chop down wood, make a house, build tools and gear, mine for ores, and defeat monsters. But while it is very common nowadays its still very solid and a perfect way to increase your hours. Speaking of crafting, there is so much stuff you can craft, such as different blocks, crafting materials, different weapons, and utility items. There are also plenty of different NPCs to house and in return you can purchase items from them with the currency system.  Include are plenty of biomes with different types of enemies and extra goodies, like Pyramids in the Desert biome or the Underground section of the lush Jungle biome. There are also 3 types of special biomes. Crimson and Corruption will eat your world if they're not handle, one has a very bloody theme while the other features a more dark theme. Then there is the Hallow with bright colors, Pixies, and murderous Unicorns, luckily this Biome unlock in Hardmode which I will get to later.  Another cool thing about Terraria is the many invasions and Bosses. Invasions can happen randomly during gameplay but they can be manually summoned and feature a onslaught of unique enemies which is very useful for grinding for currency or other items. Some invasions have mini-bosses as a part of the action. Now with the Bosses. Terraria's Bosses are crucial to proceed with the game, as their defeat activates certain things in the overworld. Most of the Pre-Hardmode are pretty easy once you have the right gear but the Hardmode Bosses offer a greater challenge. However I do wish you didn't have to defeat them in order to make something happen, just a tiny inconvenience.  Now I should talk about Hardmode, once you defeat the Wall of Flesh, a special boss in the Underworld, the game kickstarts into Hardmode with tougher enemies and bosses but with more biome and better gear. I'd say that 70% of the game is in Hardmode so, be prepared to be challenged. Speaking of which there is the Expert mode with is even tougher but has some special items you cannot get from the other modes of the game.  Visually, I love the pixel art-style for this game, it has kinda stuck over time but that does help the developers make some gorgeous looking pixel art for the bosses, as they are huge compared to the player. The background are also a fun part for the eyes as there are different background for each biome.  The Soundtrack is also very constructed with some memorable tunes, I won't get much here as the soundtrack itself is reviewable.  Overall, Terraria's success comes from is simple, yet effective gameplay with mining and defeating monsters. Pretty much anyone could pick up and play this game as its presentation is great for new players. And if the content isn't enough for you there are always Mods and they have shown to be very, very expansive. I kinda wish this game gets Workshop support to make getting said mods a bit easier but I digress. Terraria is well worth its 10$ price tag, but its sale price of $5 is even more incredible considering what you get in the base game.",93.0,Recommended,"113 people found this review helpful

105600,2024-09-13 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Please follow United Critics for quality reviews  Terraria Review  👍/👎 Pros and Cons:  👍Pros: I like the game's look. The soundtrack is good. The bosses are challenging. The almost endless things to do in this game. It takes a long time to complete the game. 👎Cons: It’s very hard to learn at first. Playing this game can easily leave you lost on how to move forward. 🎮Gameplay:  Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with a focus on exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival, and mining, which is playable both in singleplayer and multiplayer modes. The player begins in a randomly generated world with only basic tools to progress. In order to craft better tools, the player will need to mine the starter ores, such as iron and tin. As you gather these resources, you can build a house to protect yourself and make better tools and armor to fight the monsters that spawn at night. Also, you should be searching for life crystals if you want to increase your max health, and you should be searching for fallen stars if you want to increase your max mana. Mana is the ""ammo"" you need for your magic wands and items that need mana. Once you have built a house, you need to build houses for the NPCs to live in. The NPCs can sell you useful items for the money you receive from defeating enemies. There is also a guide NPC who can give you hints on what to do. You can also find NPCs around the world who need help, and when you help them, they can move into your house. It is time to explore the world and go deep into the mines to find better ores, but be aware because there are traps and strong enemies in the mines. If you don't have the appropriate pickaxe, you won't be able to mine all the ores at first. As well as the mines, you will have to go through the different biomes you will find in the game. Both are generated randomly.  Various world events may occur that make the enemies stronger, such as the blood moon, slime rain, etc. These events usually happen at night. By destroying a Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart, a meteor will fall in your world, which you can mine to craft some useful items. You can do a lot in Terraria whether you're bored or not. You can start a building project or do side missions that NPCs give you, etc. The game does not require much grinding, but it takes a while to mine enough ores. I think that much of the game should be discovered by the players themselves, so I'll leave you with just this and hope that you'll want to get into this awesome 2D game called Terraria.   There are several different biomes in the game, including the snow biome, jungle, desert, and more. There are also biomes underground that have secrets to be discovered. I won't tell you much about the biomes since exploring is part of the game, but I will say that the biomes are well designed and interesting to explore. In the mines, you will find chests with loot that could be very useful.   I won't tell you about the boss's abilities and such, because I think you should discover that for yourself as you progress. The bosses spawn when you have the right item and do a certain action with it, such as throwing it into lava or clicking on it. You can also summon bosses by speaking with some NPCs. Different areas have their own bosses to face. The bosses are well thought out, and the difficult ones are the ones near the end of the game so you don't just defeat them all with the bad loot and complete the game with that. Prepare yourself with potions and good equipment if you are going to take on one of these bosses. To progress in the game, you must defeat the bosses, because that will result in you getting more items and unlocking things in your world that you couldn't do before. This is a 16-bit style game, and I think it suits the game well.   It is possible to change some stuff in your Terraria world such as the seed, the size, difficulty. You can also decide if there will be corruption or crimson in your world. Various customization options are also available, including clothing and clothing colors, hairstyles, eye colors, and more.   If you're looking for something to play for a while and you want to always have something to do, then Terraria is the game for you. It has an excellent soundtrack and great features. The bosses are challenging, and the game takes a long time to complete. Overall, the game is excellent.  Rating: 8/10",101.6,Recommended,"109 people found this review helpful

105600,2023-09-21 00:00:00,"Support These Developers and Others Who Stand Against Unity and Other Similar Scum Corps  As soon as Unity announced they were going to charge per installation these developers publicly denounced Unity. They're donating a LOT of money to Godot and FNA to help indie developers and other game creators to stop this tyranny that Unity is seeking to do. It's time to stand united against big name corporations that are now trying to ruin and control our games, entertainment, every day lives and fun.  Re-Logic, Terraria devs, has the backbone and brass to stand against Unity's ""fecal matter"" and donate $100k a MONTH to Godot! I'm sure I'll get a lot of clowns on this review, from Unity supporters, but if you can stand behind someone like Unity, or others, who wants to literally bankrupt small companies just because they put out better games, or for greed reasons, you're part of the problem. Don't promote Unity or others who do things like they're doing. Support developers / companies like Re-Logic who CARES genuinely about their fan base and the gaming community.  If small studios with less than 1/5th of the budget of a big name developer can make a complete game, make it more fun and free from microtransactions that's the future of what should be for gaming, and life in general. Honestly it should be the future for all companies that we choose to support not just gaming! Why do you want to purchase your life together like it's IKEA furniture? EA is bad enough with their DLCs along with other companies and now Unity is trying this. Enough is enough and it's time we stand against it ALL together as a gaming community regardless of personal beliefs!  It's time to stop supporting wallet / purse / money parasite leeches of the gaming industry (and all industries for that matter) and back developers who CARE about their fan base and the gamers. So support these developers and all the other ones who don't just ""talk the talk"" about leaving unity (or scolding their nonsense). Support developers who actually openly condemn Unity that back it up with actions like Re-Logic is by sending 100K a month and supporting Godot and other indie developers to succeed.  It's time to shut up and vote with your wallet everyone. Talk is cheap and does nothing. Actions are louder than words. Put a STOP to this nonsense that corporations are doing by refusing to give them ANY money no matter their promises! Support indie developers and companies who make great games without all this nonsense and do what's right by us, our wallet and care about what we think.   Doesn't matter. Bite the hand that feeds you once you're not getting fed at all. That should be the policy and the motto we live by. Don't trust Unity or any big company that does this just due to backlash. They'll come back even harder the next time or do things behind our backs. Why would you want two daggers in your back when Unity (and other corps) already tried to put in the one? Drop unity and any other corp that does this shoddy garbage behavior to people, period!   Oh yeah by the way this game is great and fun. You can mod it or play it vanilla. Either way it's phenomenal. Also if you suffer ""in-game lag"" what fixed it for me was changing the frame skip, lights and turning the background off depending on what works best for your rig / settings. Just tinker with those until it runs smoothly. I hope that helps.   Just do yourself a favor and read the review for goodness sakes. -_-",147.4,Recommended,136 people found this review helpful 13

I had low expectations because I thought it would just be 2d minecraft, easy to get bored of. But boy was I wrong. The game is made in such a way that in order to progress with better equipment and weapons, defeating bosses is mandatory. And each time you beat a boss, the world just spawns harder enemies and makes you feel weak just like when you had nothing at the start. This game just keeps on giving, and after defeating the final boss there is still so much to do, like event bosses, rare drops, getting an overpowered sword called Zenith, and so on. The end game is so satisfying as you can bully anything in the world while focusing on building stuff, etc. The game also lets you create multiple playable characters who can join any world while keeping their own inventory. This lets you create a new world with your end game character and beat bosses all over again (except this time the fight will last for a second or two because of how overpowered you are). 10/10 would recommend to anybody.

However, due to a slightly disabled left hand, quick WASD use was out, barring me from playing.  I gimped along with Xpadder for while in both games, but it was frustrating AF. I recently revisited Terraria after picking it up on the 3ds and being pleasantly surprised with how well the control scheme worked there - I decided to try it out on PC again. And holy crap, they pulled it off, it actually works decently a controller! I do play with my keyboard and mouse nearby to quick hit keys, (If you have the physical option to use M&K it *is* more fluid due to all the mappable key options. My controller *does* have 6 extra mappable buttons on it though). But the controller works just fine!  I'm stoked, and very thankful this option was put in. Disabled gamers are out there, and as the first real generation of gamers get older, mobility issues are going to start appearing more frequently, it can never hurt to make your game as accessible as possible. So I appreciate the option to use a controller for those of us who have no choice in the matter. Terraria's a great game. It may not be as expansive as Starbound, but for those of us who need a controller for whatever reason, its actually playable.

105600,2020-09-03 00:00:00,"This is one of the best sandboxes ever I would like to start off this review by saying one thing. This is one of the best games ever made. I know most people would probably look at this game and think it's just 2D Minecraft, but it is way more than that. The main similarities are in the blocks and survival aspects of it. But actually beyond that Terraria is just so MUCH more.  Summary: Gameplay - 10.5 When you start a world for the first time it is a very slow game, but the game quickly picks up the pace. There is no hand-holding in this game whatsoever, you have to do everything yourself or check the Terraria wiki page. You change a lot during your adventure and in the end the game is very fast-paced.  Soundtrack - 10 The soundtrack is some of the best I've ever heard in a sandbox game. It's so simplistic yet so good. It is very catchy and I will never forget the iconic song Overworld Day which is instantly recognized.  Graphics - 10 Since it isn't aiming for realistic graphics you really cannot give it a bad score. It's a very specific kind of art style that fits the game very well.  Price - 10 The price is incredibly cheap compared to what you get. You get a really long game with a bunch of replay value. It costs 9,99€ on Steam but often goes down to 4.99€ during sales. It's a great price. Terraria is a fantastic game that has everything you would ever want in a game like this. You should really buy this if you want a really good sandbox game. The developers have been supporting this game for years now and still have 1 last update left called Journey's End.   ⢀⡴⠑⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠸⡇⠀⠿⡀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡴⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⢄⣠⠾⠁⣀⣄⡈⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡀⠁⠀⠀⠈⠙⠛⠂⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⡿⢿⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⢀⡾⣁⣀⠀⠴⠂⠙⣗⡀⠀⢻⣿⣿⠭⢤⣴⣦⣤⣹⠀⠀⠀⢀⢴⣶⣆ ⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣮⣽⣾⣿⣥⣴⣿⣿⡿⢂⠔⢚⡿⢿⣿⣦⣴⣾⠁⠸⣼⡿ ⠀⢀⡞⠁⠙⠻⠿⠟⠉⠀⠛⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣌⢤⣼⣿⣾⣿⡟⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⣾⣷⣶⠇⠀⠀⣤⣄⣀⡀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠉⠈⠉⠀⠀⢦⡈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣶⣶⣤⣽⡹⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠲⣽⡻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣜⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣷⣶⣮⣭⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⠻⠿⠿⠿⠿⠛⠉",166.7,Recommended,"85 people found this review helpful

105600,2018-01-21 00:00:00,"Wait It Isn't a Minecraft Clone?  Terraria one of those games you could play forever and never get tired. The amount of replayability in this game is insane. With over 3000+ items and dozens of bosses, the game becomes very enjoyable with friends or by yourself. Terraria is a basic 2D sandbox game comparable to Minecraft. However, the amount of content within the game is comparable to playing Minecraft with mods. Having played both games myself for extensive hours, I can firmly say Terraria is the better game.  When starting the game, it can be very overwhelming as the items and their purpose can be very confusing. As you progress through the game, it becomes very fun with the variety of weapons and monsters you'll encounter along the way. Discovering all the weapons and items inside the game is probably one of best parts of the game as there is so many different ways the game could be played.  The game's replayability truly shines with the different weapon types and difficulty modes the game could be played in. The game two different game modes, normal and expert. Expert mode makes the game actually challenging by adding a ton of new abilities specific to monsters and bosses  This game's low point is the multiplayer feature. Multiplayer with up to 5 players is fun but when you introduce too many players, the game becomes too easy to complete, or the game gets completed too fast.  Overall, Terraria is an amazing game worth every penny spent. This game is an easy 10/10 and is very fun with or without friends.","1,243.7",Recommended,"117 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-03-20 00:00:00,"Terraria: Sand Is Overpowered  - Graphics :  2-D vibrant graphics with block-like textures and a ""washed"" look. No HD, ultra-high settings. Just plain old sprites with 2-D.    - Sound :  Electric-type soundtrack. It's a bit unique since it sounds completely original and could almost be classified as something new. Soundtrack aside, all of the items and enemies and humans sound believable. Laser guns have a laser sound, a slime enemy makes a jello sound when it's killed, the player will emit a pain sound when attacked. Again, nothing weird or out of the ordinary since it's a pretty simple concept.    - Gameplay :  2-D sidescrolling, using the WASD keys to move up, down, left and right. Since it's a sandbox game, there's lots of things to create. You will primarily be mining the blocks that compose the entire Terraria world you create in order to make items like armor and weapons or buildings. PVP is also included, but is restricted to online server use. There are bosses to defeat, NPCs to find, thousands of items to create or collect, miles upon miles of caverns to explore beneath the ground, and of course sky islands to explore. There is water, lava and honey. Terraria is all about exploring and combat, with creation being a minor, but still vital, part of the game.","3,196.6",Recommended,"142 people found this review helpful

Asside from the fact that there is no clear guidelines on how to progress. It is very appealing to look at [For me atleast], Ive played hundreds and hundreds of hours on Ive played multiplayer with up to 8 mates all smashing our way through the world, Everything is pretty easy, Even when on Expert mode, But thats why you got such things as mods, Thorium, Spirit and many others. Each boss has its own unique set of abilities and style which is good, If youre looking for a new game to play whilst you got time, Id highly suggest Mainly because you'll say ""Im getting off in 10 minutes"", Meanwhile an hour later and you're still havent finished doing whatever it is you were going to do  Overall is a great game, Highly recommended from my behalf  Happy gaming, Toshi~","1,848.8",Recommended,"74 people found this review helpful

105600,2016-07-04 00:00:00,"Well I think it's about time to review this gem.  Terraria is one of the best value-per-dollar games you can buy on steam. Period. Obviously some of the free-to-play games can match that value (because you spend nothing) but the amount of content in this game is just ridiculous!  Ever since 1.0, there have been 3 absolutely game-changing updates, for completely free. The game was already worth it just at 1.0, apart from bugs, but then they litterally quadrupuled or quintupled every aspect of the game. 1.0 got the basics right; satisfying combat, fun exploration, lots of sandboxy things to do, but as I just said, it's sandboxy; there's a lack of an appropriate ending besides ""get the most powerful stuff."" 1.3 gave us the Moon Lord which is the equivilant of the Ender Dragon from Minecraft; it doesn't end your game after you defeat it but it's something tough even with the gear you get from him, so it feels like a climactic end.  You'll start off small with your copper shortsword, or maybe you build the wooden broadsword to replace it. After many hours you'll have slowly went through the arsenal of weapons and armor the game provides you, from bows to guns to MAGIC, and from simple ""take less damage"" armor to armor that has really unique effects such as allowing you to reflect damage and draw aggro from enemies for your friends.  On top of the weaponry you have all of the things to do with blockbuilding. There's so many pieces of furnature and different materials you can use to make something that looks amazing, and then you can customize it further by changing shapes with a hammer or recoloring blocks through the paint gun. On top of those cosmetic things you also have the (as of a recent update) fairly extensive wiring system that can allow you to create some pretty cool traps or other mechanisms such as spawning enemies or opening/closing doors.  And on top of THAT you have the massive variety of enemies to fight, some of which will completely obliterate you and you'll enjoy every minute of it. All of the bosses have their unique elements and you'll definitely be surprised the first time a signature move comes out (like the first time that the Corruption boss comes out of the ground).  AND ON TOP OF THAT you have a thriving modding community if the base game doesn't have enough content. Whether you just want more content or complete overhauls, the modding community's got you covered in user-friendly mod managers and easy mod installation.  So basically I'm saying the game's pretty good and you should buy it if you haven't already with how often it goes on 50% and 75% sales.  EDIT: Also you guys should totally nominate this game for the ""Test of Time"" reward because the game has always been great and it just keeps getting better and it's one of those games that pretty much every person on Steam has enjoyed at one point and returned to it at another when updates come out.",996.8,Recommended,"90 people found this review helpful

There is so much to do in this game that make this so-called ""Minecraft clone"" unique and rewarding.

I don't know...  I have 500+ hours of playtime in this game, and had... great fun. Don't get me wrong, it's still a fun game, and the final major update is simply amazing... but, I've already done so many things within my playtime, such as building a nice base for my NPCs, defeating bosses (including Dungeon Guardian), defeating events, beating expert difficulty, building teleport spots, hellevators, traps, arenas, fishing spots in every biome, getting or crafting all weapons, getting all banners, etc, etc, you name it. I'm pretty sure many others like me are in the same boat. But I feel like I'm burnt out. I don't know, maybe the game ended for me after that final boss in 1.3...  Now, the game still is an amazing experience full of possibilities if you like building stuff using your creativity. The latest update adds a lot to that, as well. We also have mod tools now, which is awesome. I think (well, I hope) I'll be back one day to start a new game and build stuff once again. I can already see myself trying new stuff, but, I just can't bring myself back to it.  To put it simply, Terraria is a game that keeps on giving.

105600,2023-04-29 00:00:00,"Terraria is a game that has stood the test of time and continues to captivate players with its unique blend of exploration, combat, and creativity. This 2D sandbox game has been a favorite among gamers since its initial release in 2011, and it's easy to see why.  The game offers a vast and dynamic world to explore, filled with a variety of biomes, enemies, and treasures to discover. From the underground depths of the earth to the heights of the sky, there's always something new and exciting to uncover.  But Terraria isn't just about exploring - it also offers a robust combat system that will challenge even the most seasoned players. With an array of weapons, armor, and accessories to choose from, players can tailor their playstyle to suit their preferences and take on the game's bosses with confidence.  And let's not forget about the game's creative potential. With a plethora of building materials and tools at your disposal, you can let your imagination run wild and create everything from towering castles to intricate pixel art. The possibilities are endless, and the satisfaction of seeing your creations come to life is truly rewarding.  But what sets Terraria apart from other games in its genre is the sense of community it fosters. Whether you're playing with friends or joining a public server, the game encourages collaboration and creativity. From building massive structures together to taking on the game's challenges as a team, Terraria is a game that brings people together.  In conclusion, Terraria is a game that has something for everyone. Its vast world, engaging combat, and creative potential make it a must-play for any fan of sandbox games. But it's the sense of community that really sets it apart and makes it a game that will continue to be enjoyed for years to come.",35.9,Recommended,"86 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-04-11 00:00:00,"It'S 2-d MInecRaFt... said some boring chumps who refuse to play because of its similarities, while ignoring Fortnite's similarities to PubG. This game is more than 2-D Minecraft in its different styles, great 8bit music, affectionate pixel art and all- round attention, so much so that I believe it to be superior to Minecraft. It's not MC is bad, but just has some downsides... [HUGE TEXT FROM BLABBERING GUY AHEAD] __Comparing Terraria to Minecraft__ 1. Minecraft has a (in my opinion) weird progression structure- you mine underground until you find diamonds, game over- and makes the Nether and End feel only optional. The boss in MC doesn't really give you anything other than a decoration item and loads of empty islands, with one that gives you wings and some stuff. That makes it feel like a half-done ending. Meanwhile, Terraria has a better progression structure, involving killing bosses and getting gradually stronger until you beat the Moon Lord. That feels like a true ending, but really this is just a nitpick on MC. Sorry! 2. Minecraft has a limited amount you can do with it, which made me tire of it eventually. This is probably due to there being only 8 weapons and 5 armours, which restricts how many ways you can play. In Terraria, however, there are lots of weapons, armours and accessories and different classes to play as. This keeps the game fun since there are so many different ways to go through it, plus free and amazing mods too. (BTW I know Minecraft has mods, but I'm not sure many can contend with the huge, incredible, enchanting Calamity Mod which is basically a game on its own. Still, MC's mods are good.) 3. The most controversial one... Minecraft hasn't really got as much detail put into it. for example, biomes: Biomes in MC just means different blocks and a few new enemies that drop basic stuff. In Terraria, there's more detail put into those biomes, like loads of unique items, unique music and lots of biome-specific enemies. Although, MC does have a lot more detail in its oceans and does put effort into the Nether, so it isn't all bad. 4. THE WANDERING TRADER!! This I just can't forgive. The Wandering Trader is an obvious copy of the Travelling Merchant, but with nothing good that it had. Why, instead of getting 5 times more off the ground right where you live which regrow every two days, pay 6 emeralds for ONE FLOWER!? All he sells are weeds and junk, which is a big step down from the Travelling Merchant's good weapons, useful informative items and helpful food. The Wandering Trader just pops up around your house, doing all he can for him and his llama to make as much noise as possible to drive you insane. Then, as you look around to find him and shut him up, he drinks an invisibility potion and/or spawns in the greatest hiding spot in the area. The worst thing is that he has no use other than being annoying, and the only things I find him useful for is archery practice and eviscerating him to keep his nice-looking llama. Sorry about the wordy text and if it seems like I'm hating on MC, it's a good game. It's just I hate people who take one look at good games like Terraria and hate them for appearing like something else. I also took the opportunity to compare the games (sorry if it seems one-sided, I just love Terraria so much because both are so good, but could be so much better if they looked at each other more often and improved their games (EXCLUDING THE WANDERING TRADER, MINECRAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE ""IMPROVED"" ITSELF THEN). In brief, Terraria is a well-made sandbox RPG with flaws and potential, and not a Minecraft clone. Edit:So... my opinion changed a little after my opinion. People will ask why I don't post a bad review on Minecraft, and the answer is I don't want to directly give a bad review on a game that has potential, and I don't HATE.I don't necessarily despise MC, so take it easy when you read this. Also there will be loads of 8-year-olds screaming at me about an opinion that isn't part of their collective minds' blind following of the game played by their favourite (i.e the most unbearable they can find) Youtuber, and I don't want to cause a huge argument so I'm ranting where most won't look. Sorry for all the words...  After writing I played Minecraft again and I'm SHOCKED what's happened to it. It feels a lot more soulless than when I first played it, all the new stuff that they added seems exciting but was just... disappointing. I found an ocean monument, which looked cool, but only contained gold and some new blocks, so it was of no use and was just a disappointment. I raided a pillager outpost, I really wanted to know what was inside, but it was just generic chest loot and one new weapon that doesn't stand out much- a bigger disappointment. I then gave up on Survival after realising that there wasn't really much point to it anymore . I spent three sessions playing Survival, it just felt so abandoned, like it was just there because it was there originally. Call me petty, but that really made me like the game less.  Then, I played Creative mode, trying to build something, since blocks were almost the only thing being added (I said ALMOST, don't hurt me) and tried to build a house. This is where I reach something else I now dislike about the game...  REDSTONE SORTA SUCKS. It's over-complicated, the commands are fiddly and annoying, and I had to watch 6 TUTORIALS to make an item open a door! I know there are redstone masters out there, but it pains me as I wonder how long, how many excruciating hours it takes to get quite good at it. It's one of those cases where if they just took a page out of Terraria's book it would have massively improved the game. Think about it! Terraria's engineering system is pretty much a simple, easy concept to understand, but can do everything that Minecraft can. The wiring in Terraria doesn't eat up the odd 30x5x2 block space underneath your build, limiting what you can do. It doesn't need to have circuits that break if you place wires in a 2 by 2 space (redstone goes into a circle when you do that and stops working. It's simple, and can do so much!  I know I'm going to be bullied for adding this, people were already telling me how wrong I was to convey my opinion, but I really think replaying Minecraft has made it considerably less enjoyable to me. It's why I enjoy Terraria more, I'm only 12, I don't want to spend hours placing blocks or putting down wiring that usually doesn't work. I want a game that I can have fun with, not feel annoyed with and go round in circles. I don't hate Minecraft, but I think after Notch left, the game just lost its charm for me. One of the things I hate the most besides THAT TRADER is how the game just churns out updates every six months and shows no sign of stopping. My personal opinion is that Microsoft don't really care about the game they bought, they just keep updating it because ""it's Minecraft"" and people will buy it, and create low-effort updates to make sure that the 8-year-olds' attention spans don't run out and move on by adding a dribble of content, and give obnoxious Youtubers something to yell about and do let'splays on, dragging more 8-year-olds into Minecraft (sorry for the cliche view on that). At least the Terraria devs have decided to step away and finish with game-changing, good content, they didn't feel the need to keep it alive forever, milk it and stop caring about it other than for a paycheck.  Now, I do definitely prefer the chill, not-advertised-everywhere-with-merchandise-of-everything adventure of Terraria (I know they have merch too, but it's not too much and relatively hard to find), but I haven't given up hope on Minecraft yet. It may not be half of what it used to be, but I believe that there's still a chance that the game's production falls into the hands of a real fan, someone who will pull Minecraft back onto its feet, someone who puts the care and love into the game like Notch did, and like how each Terraria update di",127.2,Recommended,"407 people found this review helpful

105600,2020-02-07 00:00:00,"After finally obtaining all achievements for the game, it's time to actually write a review. First thoughts on Terraria was the stereotypical mentality that it's ""Oh just another Minecraft clone. Nothing special from something that rips off the original classic."" However, after picking up the game(at the recommendation of a few friends who have tried and played/streamed the game), it was time to get into a game that has mostly positive reviews and high ratings. Now why would what is considered as ""Another Minecraft rip-off"" be so highly regarded and praised by the community?  It is clear that Terraria is not a Minecraft clone after a couple of hours into the game. Despite the fact that it has the same blocky concept of its ""predecessor"", most similarities end as there are many distinctions that can be made from it being 2D to its more ""combat-system"" focused style of farming.  What to like about the game: 1. It's fun. No really. You can sink hours into the game before you realise what time it is as there is so much to do and explore in the game. Like fighting bosses? They have anything from the Slime King and Queen Bee to The Eater of Worlds and Moon Lord. Only prefer to build? No problem, you can create a world that's solely dedicated to constructing your magnificent structures. Like fishing? Grab a rod, some bait and find a patch of water, honey or even lava to fish in! No matter what you want to do in-game, Terraria will have it all.  2. Classes. The 4 main classes most Terraria veterans will list down are Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner(RIP Thrower). You can easily pick any class early on but not devote to it as there is no ""skill-tree"" to put points into. Only your armor and choice of weapon would define your class. You could even go for hybrid-classes if you wish to! The only thing to take into consideration would be your level of expertise and preferred playstyle.  3. Two different modes. Terraria offers something Minecraft does not, a different difficulty setting you choose when you create a world. It offers a ""normal"" mode for newer players who are unused to the game (and don't want to die at the start) and an ""expert"" mode for players who wish to have a more ""challenging"" experience. Why go for the expert option? Well, it offers more money upon defeating enemies and it even has exclusive loot which can only be obtained in this level of difficulty. With the release of the final update of Terraria, a new ""Master"" mode will be added and be the highest level of the game for players to challenge themselves with.  Cons: 1. Terraria must seem like such a great game right? However, it does have one thing that may put players off: Grinding. Grinding for materials or items will seem tedious to some especially with the low drop-rates and RNGesus messing with players.  2. Its end-game. After you've ""finished"" the game, it may seem like the game has offered everything it can. As such, it may be boring for players to play alone in Singleplayer, so it would be better for them to play on Multiplayer servers or with friends(If you don't have any who play this game yet, try and encourage them to!). Or you could also download any of the mods they have to completely revamp the game and have a new playing experience!  All in all, Terraria is a great game that will offer countless hours of entertainment.",461.3,Recommended,"82 people found this review helpful

105600,2016-12-11 00:00:00,"I love this game! What I love about it is that it is fairly easy and low-key when you first start, so you can learn how to play the game and find stuff without being overwelmed, but is still challenging. I played this game with a friend and he gave me a basic rundown of what you do in the game, but if you come into the game completely new, it can be confusing to know what you are actually suppose to do. You have to explore your world to gain any stuff, and as you gain more stuff you also risk finding bad creatures and eventually a boss. As your character gets stronger the game gets harder, but it still never feels impossible to complete. I also like that you can play this game over and over and still find new things to do, it never really feels completed to me. I have over 400 hrs in this game and I still haven't completed Duke Fishtron or Moon Lord on hardmode. I really like building towns and castles, you can make farms and machines, completely explore your map, dig tunnels and elevators to get around quickly, and you can build battle towers and test them by summoning events like the Blood/Frost/Pumpkin moon. Once you have your character built up as much as you can you can also do hardmode and expert, both are very challenging and fun. It is kind of funny how quickly you defeat the low level bosses like the Eye of Cthulhu once you are really strong. If you have a really powerful summoner active, sometimes they can kill the small bosses before they even appear in your field of vision.  You can play with/against friends too, but getting the game actually set up and able to play multi-player is kind of a hastle, but once you have it figured out is is a lot of fun. The game also has a cheeky sense of sarcasim and adult humor that never gets old.  Overall I love the game, it is easily one of my favorites!",739.3,Recommended,"71 people found this review helpful

105600,2024-11-21 00:00:00,"Terraria is a game of trial and error. If your only experience thus far with sandbox survival is Minecraft, then you will have a bit of a learning curve when jumping in.  Almost nothing is told to the player upon starting out--you have one other soul who spawns in beside you, and if you don't talk to him and heed his advice on how to get going, then you can expect a lot of fumbling. That's not to say it isn't fun stumbling into caves and dying in frustrating ways, but you soon get items that you don't quite know what to do with, you don't know to start building a base that will attract new NPCs (or what those requirements are), and even then, your resources are slim. Most are reusable, but you don't know that from the outset.  Your first world or two is going to look ugly. Trudging through the different biomes and figuring out how to get to new areas without dying, or how to mine ore and turn it into ingots, without looking at the Wiki once? If you can figure it out, then you have a better chance at survival.  I truly, truly love this game, but I understand that it is NOT very easy for new players unless you just throw yourself at it and are okay with failure. Don't worry about money at the start, you'll make plenty of it later--don't be the hero. You don't drop items upon death, just money. Play with every new item you get. Look at every icon on your HUD and inventory, talk to the Guide. Don't be afraid to click on anything, even if it looks like a trap (it might be a trap).  I play solo, but I know this game is even more fun with friends around to help figure it out. You can get really creative with item loadouts and customization, it just takes time to get there. Go out, start digging, and uhhh don't worry about the moon. It's fine.",137.0,Recommended,"67 people found this review helpful

105600,2014-11-19 00:00:00,"I sometimes find myself envying people who sit down to play an outstanding video game for the first time. It's like a Christmas morning: putting the toy back under the tree and tearing opening the box all over again will never quite replicate the excitement of seeing it for the first time. Terraria is this sort of game. Starting a new world with a new character still feels like an exciting adventure, but the experience of stepping into that bright two-dimensional world for the first time, and discovering piece-by-piece all that it has hidden, is worth the asking price all by itself. Subsequent playthroughs only add to the value, and how! And if it's on sale - it is, often - I can only advise you not to hesitate.  Terraria is a very versatile game. You can play for hours at a time, clocking up days' worth of play, and still have a 'to-do' list as long as a Bone Serpent. Alternatively, you can casually dip in and out when the mood suits you, building a little here, digging a little there, working on some great artifice a bit at a time. You can challenge gods and monsters with the finest weaponry crafted from the rarest metals, or simply make a treehouse for all your NPC friends with matching furniture sets and mood lighting. Become an arctic explorer! Go fishing! Drain the ocean into the dungeon! (I have actually done this, it was hard work but good fun.) Go to hell - literally! You can try to be bored, but it will take a lot of effort.  One of the advantages Terraria has over so many other games is the involvement of a dedicated development team. When updates come - and they may not come forever - they add great stores of content to the game, with new NPCs, items, mechanics, enemies and locations, not to mention all the tweaks and fixes which aim at keeping everything balanced, no small feat given that every change has to keep Terraria accessible to new players, whilst offering bigger and better challenges to existing players whose kingdoms span from ocean to ocean. This is all done remarkably well: the devs maintain a good community, and there is always the sense that the players are being listened to when new content arrives, without ever compromising the creative vision behind it. In an age of cowboy developers, corporate spin and micro-transactions on every street corner, Terraria is a welcome example of good practice in video games, and if I needed to buy it again, I would quite happily pay the full price - although, as I said, sales do happen.  Of course, nothing is perfect, and nothing is for everyone. When it comes to armour and weapons, and things forged out of fantastically rare ores, it can be very 'grindy' (if that's a word). Building anything of any real size takes time, as does the collection of large quantities of wood and stone and whatever else you may be using to put together your palace. Boss fights can take a lot of preparation, and the later-stage bosses can feel genuinely punishing when attempted repeatedly. As a rule, I find that Terraria is very good at compensating for these issues, (a quick trip to collect wood for house-building can turn into a hectic race through zombie-infested tundra, or an expedition to recover unknown loot from the bottom of some murky chasm,) but not everyone will want to give it their time. A mere two dimensions may be a deal-breaker for some, not to mention the rather old-school, pixel-y art style. But even if this sounds like you, I recommend giving it a try. For me, Terraria worked where Minecraft didn't, and I still feel that the former deserves some of the credit that is typically heaped upon the latter. So give it a go, walk around that forest for the first time, dig a little below the surface and see if the spirit of adventure takes you. If it does, keep digging - after one year and 262 hours of play, I still haven't stopped.","2,401.7",Recommended,"127 people found this review helpful

105600,2013-07-24 00:00:00,"Oddly enough, Terraria was the first game I'd bought on Steam. I had been away from PC gaming for a fair amount of time and a good friend had discovered the game on SA and started pestering me to play. The buy in was dirt cheap and it looked mighty weird with it's retro chic graphics, but I figured if said friend was so fired up about it, I might as well give it ago. All of the praise I could find at the time compared it to Minecraft, so I was a bit leary. I'd watched my kid play hours of Minecraft and it just wasn't my bag. I'm glad I was able to push that stigma aside, because I ended up finding a gem of a game that pulled me away from my fancy consoles for a good chunk of time.  We've all been kids; kids love to explore. Exploration is the foundation of Terraria. You start out with nothing more than a pick axe and a large map, then you're left with simply trying to figure out what's there. Start to dig, maybe build a house and you're off and running.  There's something mentally satisfying about being able to click away at the soft earth, digging a path ever deeper. It may seem pointless, but as you tunnel down, maybe you take a jog to your right and all of a sudden a hidden cave opens up before you. Dig some more, perhaps you find an underground lake. Maybe after a few hours of digging, you find something far more sinister. Then, you spice things up by spinning up a server and letting your friends join you, and now you're working in conjunction, worming your way through the contryside with a misdrected sense of manifest destiny, coupled with the thrill of shouting 'ooh, look what I found!' and getting them to come see.  Terraria's not flashy, but it doesn't need to be. It's a relaxing good time and it'll bring you a wee bit of the childhood joy of exploring.",23.8,Recommended,588 people found this review helpful 0

105600,2020-12-02 00:00:00,"Terraria is a 2D RPG with building and crafting elements and some limited exploration. The primary goal of the game is to improve your gear and take on progressively difficult bosses. Along the way you will have to manage NPC's housing and towns, build structures for defence, utility and housing, mine ore and continue to craft better armours, weapons and equipment to face these escalating challenges. You will also have to deal with cleansing (or keeping at bay) corruption/crimson (depending on your generated world), which is an evil biome that spreads throughout your world. Later on you will contend with additional biomes and the challenges they bring.  Graphically it has a simple, yet pleasing aesthetic, reminiscent of ""old-school"" 16-bit platformers. It's beautiful in its own way and has the advantage of being able to run on pretty much anything. Sound and music are equally as fitting - and the whole package fits really well together.  The game also has a sandbox element to it, where you can just ignore objectives and build, explore or do whatever you want. Your character is independent of a world and can freely move between them, meaning you can create a world for building magnificent structures only if that's what you want, and have another focused towards completion. Worlds are randomly generated based on a seed with a few options including difficulty and world size, along with the choice of crimson or corruption, which are different versions of the evil biome that spawn different monsters, items and bosses.  There are 4 different classes that you will eventually be swayed to move into, including melee, ranged, magic or summoning. Each of these offer very different playstyles, powers and weapons. There should be something here for everyone - and hybrid classes are possible should you wish. There is no level up or experience system. Your character progresses by getting better equipment. This also means you can farm equipment for all classes and switch between them when you wish.  It features multiplayer - both with dedicated servers and drop-in-out play via Steam. It is great fun to play with friends, where you can team up to take on challenges or just let your creativity free and make the fun for yourself.  There is a lot to see and do here, giving it immense replay value and the gameplay loop is addictive and fun. Anyone interested in RPG's, sandboxes, crafting and building should give it a go as it may surprise you with just how well made the game is.",238.1,Recommended,"76 people found this review helpful

105600,2024-08-15 00:00:00,"Not often do I review games I enjoy, but the mindless wave of negative reviews has made me want to write SOMETHING.  Terraria is a game of passion, obvious from the decade the developers have spent updating and improving on the already-solid framework. It features some of the best 2-D combat I've ever experienced, a gorgeous art style, and a very satisfying progression.  All this is not to mention the countless high quality fan-made mods - Calamity, Thorium, and many others add dozens (if not hundreds) of extra hours of gameplay. The players are just as passionate about this game as the developers.  Most negative reviews (at the time of writing) don't criticize the game itself, rather the fact the devs don't share their political ideologies. It's disappointingly childish. While the game does have its flaws, don't look to these reviews for them right now.  If, by some off-chance, you are reading this and have never played the game, try it out! It may introduce you to a new favorite! Don't let the drama scare you off.",894.4,Recommended,"168 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-11-28 00:00:00,"Introduction Terraria is a pixelized sandbox survival game originally released in 2011. It has a long history of success, being released on multiple different gaming platforms and receiving free content updates across the decade up to this very day. Just recently, the devs teamed up with Don’t Starve developers Klei to create a major crossover event between both games. At first glance, you may be tempted to compare Terraria to be a 2D Minecraft, but oh boy are you wrong. Truth be told, reviewing this game is not an easy task, since its best to experience it with as little prior knowledge as possible. As such, I will try to keep potential spoilers to a minimum and will focus on the more general outline of this game.   The basic idea is survival – build your first home, weapons, tools – everything you need for your continuous adventures throughout the beautiful random generated worlds Terraria offers. The game can be played (and finished!) solo or with friends and while the UI may feel aged at times, the huge amounts of customization options in the vanilla game can always be expanded using mods. Together with your friends, you will explore deep mushroom caverns, deserts filled with treacherous traps and even reach for the sky, all of these representing only a glimpse of the unique biomes contained within this game. Gathering useful loot and making many new friends along your path, while occasionally struggling with one or the other tougher foe, until you reach a foul and devastated land…   This land is dark, filled with stench and monstrous enemies and represents one of the many surprises this game holds in stock for the new player. While you previously travelled beautiful fields filled with sunflowers under a blue sky, this biome is full of death and decay. Direct story telling is not something Terraria will try to convey. Instead, the player must focus on gathering clues, making friends and progressing through the various biomes to unravel the many secrets this mysterious land holds. This will ultimately kickstart a series of events subliminally guiding the players journey throughout the game.   While the pixel art style may be off-putting at first, it is in fact very charming and allows Terraria to visualize both extremely pleasant as well as dark biomes incredibly well. The world in general feels highly dynamic, with certain events (such as rain) causing a series of event-specific mobs to spawn (e.g. enemies carrying umbrellas). The sound design of this game is particularly fantastic. Every biome song slaps. Hard. At times this will suit the games laid-back atmosphere well, but it can also significantly increase your pulse during high tension boss battles.   In conclusion, Terraria is an awesome survival experience for solo players or together with friends. While time is slowly taking its toll, the game is still tons of fun and features in-depth crafting mechanics, customization options, mod support, random world generation and unlimited replayability. Terraria arguably should have received the Steam-Award 2020 for the continuous support of the indie development studio behind it and especially since it received its major Journey’s End update last year, but lost to Counter Strike: Global Offensive in a head on head fight. I say, let’s give Terraria the Steam Award it deserves, let’s show the devs our appreciation and celebrate Terrarias 10 year anniversary together!    Game voted for the Steam-Award 2021.",136.4,Recommended,"75 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-12-26 00:00:00,"Minecraft had a love-child with Metroid and they called it Terrarria.  It’s a 2D Action-Platformer, bullet hell, survival game in a procedurally generated world. It features different Biomes, Mobs, Bosses, a slew of mechanics and most importantly… loot. So MUCH god d a m n loot! Hidden everywhere in the world, as boss drops, as rare-drops etc.  It has crafting and building mechanics, just like Minecraft. Your gear gradually improves as you progress for you to be able to face ever more dangerous enemies.  You can either play on baby difficulty with God mode or die about as much as Dark Souls on the hardest difficulty.  It’s single or multiplayer - there are multiple world sizes. You can host worlds, or join a server.  In short: It’s glorious.  There’s not a single person on planet Earth who doesn’t enjoy Terrarria so you’re doing yourself a disservice by not playing it.  10/10","1,001.5",Recommended,"245 people found this review helpful

The idea of a 2D minecraft has not pushed me into the game initially, but eventually I gave it a try to play in Co-op with friends, and in a reasonable amount of hours and I was very impressed with the ton of content that this game has.  Gigantic maps to dig, events to do, tons of different mobs, great bosses, amazing content for crafting, NPCs, skills and abilities. Go to the sky, go to Hell. Start chopping some trees at the beggining, end up litterally flying with laser guns, ridding unicorns, being a werewolf, and so on.  The game also has some boring times, a bunch of time spent on research to know what to do next, what to craft, where to go, but in the end it will be worth it.",33.5,Recommended,"113 people found this review helpful

This is the perfect game if you want something to play with your friends and relax or go out and boss farm, or even just play through survival with them and test your self with the new difficulty (Makes it more interesting in my opinion). I love that fact that this game doesn't force you to pick a play style, you can create hybrid classes, and even be a yoyo class (random i know) but its still rather powerful if you build it correctly.

105600,2014-01-14 00:00:00,"After putting hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game, A review: The basic game has been developed a lot through it's lifetime, and is very solid. There are a few overpowered things here and there (such as the very early obtained gem grappling hooks with massive range) but it's a very solid balance over all. Lots of objects you will find will already be useless because you've found better, but each time you play through the game, who knows, you might just happen upon an item earlier than usual. What you'll want to play this game for is the multiplayer. Playing alone is all well and good, but playing with friends, building projects with them, that's what can't be beaten. The bosses are incredibly difficult to beat alone anyway, so it'll make your life a lot easier to work with others. I seem to always manage to get a lot more hours from this game every time someone new decides they'll play it with me.  Finally, a suggestion. 1. Get this game. 2. Play on a LARGE world. Small worlds run out of space to explore quickly, and it'll mean anything you build isn't kept, because when you finish exploring a world, you'll want to go to another. Sky islands will be more difficult to find, and you'll have to build outposts close to the dungeon and the jungle so you don't keep having to run from your original spawn, but it's worth it. It'll also mean the corruption won't spread over your house as quickly once you get into hardmode.",983.2,Recommended,76 people found this review helpful 0

But it turned out I was very wrong thinking in such way, after I got slightly further into the game, which had me devoured fully. The way progression works in Terraria is such a satisfying process to go through, even if sometimes, it my get a bit grindy, be it the bosses or or looting tons of materials. Hours of non-stop playing were spent on it, and I fully admit that it was worth it! In addition to that, I hope that new players of the game, that have never seen it before won't stop after an hour of first time gameplay, because the seemingly boring beginning will eventually turn out into a very fun, long and entertaining journey, full of various emotions on the way.

When someone plays by themselves they can play at their own rate and go about obstacles in their own way (such as a guide on the internet). An experienced player may progress too quickly and overwhelm a new player to the point where they become disinterested. They should be allowed to progress the game at their own rate and guided as to what needs to be done when they become stuck. As well as this, introducing multiple people to Terraria at once has also proved difficult in my experience. People tend to want to do their own thing in an open game like Terraria and may miss out on important parts of progression. Of course, this depends on the people you are playing with and you can make your judgement based on their tendencies. Once they are up to speed however, the game becomes that much more enjoyable for everyone. Overall, despite having said more on the learning curve of the game for new players, I truly believe this game is brilliant and worth a try from just about everybody.","1,049.3",Recommended,"68 people found this review helpful

105600,2021-06-24 00:00:00,"-Accepted by the Leguminati-  My sister played this for hours and I always wondered why. Finally I received this game, I believe my brother purchased it for me. I played. I built a house in a cave. I had a chainsaw. My brother had bombs. My name was Zen.  My brother used bombs. In my house cave. By ‘accident.’  He didn’t tell me, he tried to cover it up and put everything back the way he found it. He did pretty good. But I knew something was off. Ever since then I have hidden my bombs from him.  Then, I visited his world. His world boated a huge apartment complex. Half underground as there was a huge hill on one side of it. I would never use bombs on his house. Not even by accident. I placed my bombs in my inventory so I didn’t accidentally use them in a quick slot.  I had wings. I flew into the skies. I found a cloud. A cloud full of water. I had an idea.  His village was destined for a… different type of revenge. All of my siblings made buckets. We made buckets with the iron of my brother’s world. We scooped water from everywhere. We hollowed out the cloud and filled it with water.  My brother, the bomb wielding maniac, maybe he didn’t deserve this fate. In fact, I know he didn’t. He didn’t mean to blow up my cave house. He tried to fix it. But filling a cloud with buckets and buckets of water was just too fun.  “Come to your village!” I told him.  He came. And the flood began.  I can still remember his sad, confused cries of despair as water flooded his homes. He closed the doors where he could to stop the damage. Torches and tiki torches came off the walls. Water. Water everywhere.  He was such a good sport. He didn’t fight or scream or curse or call me names. He laughed.  I felt bad. He tried to fix what he had done to my home and I flooded his and he laughed.  Living in fear and shame I returned to my world of ‘Zen’s World.’ I had to do something.  Someone doesn’t just laugh at their flooded world without plans of revenge.  I had to flood proof my home.  First, I dug deep down. Halfway to the underground. I hollowed out a massive chunk of land and called it a water pit. I made holes in the floors of my houses that would drain down into this massive pit. Ha. Flood proof. Revenge proof.  In the following weeks, when I tried to load into my world. The file was corrupt.  Zen’s World was broken. I tried everything.  Oh well. I made a new world. Sad Land. I knew my first goal. It was to make a water pit. A bigger, deeper, fuller water pit. It took days to dig it. Maybe weeks. I decided to make it a little nicer. I lined it in stone slab and made platforms every ten blocks so that it was noob friendly. It had lights in air bubbles to light the water. A new house in a cave. This one had a tower for the wizard to move into. It was made of bricks and it had a chimney. It had cobwebs and mossy stone. It had a crystal ball.  I made the drain pipes lead down into the water pit. My home was flood proof. Revenge proof.  A few weeks later, I logged into my world. My character was corrupt! This was terrible. Everything I had collected from this world and the last was gone. My gold, my platinum. My pet dinosaur. My molten pickaxe.  It’s fine. I needed a new character to help me figure out how to do things completely fresh. My new character was named Xen.  Hello Xen! Welcome to Sad Land. Only, not. Sad Land was corrupt, too.  I was sad. I was the sad land now. Well… all that was left to do was to make a new world. I wanted to see the best in making a new character. It was hard. But now I had to see the best in making a new world, too.  Welcome to California Land, Xen.  I dug a water pit. A massive water pit. With a copper pickaxe. I dug to the underground. It was over 120 blocks wide. It was framed with 5 blocks of brick all around. It took forever.  I showed my siblings. I built a big city.  We beat the bosses. Pirate invasions. Goblin armies. We sacrificed Jeff to the lava god. We beat the mechanical bosses, all at once. We beat Plantera after coming to the realization we needed to make a stadium. We dug a huge arena and beat the mean flower.  We beat the Golem after the traps brutally dissected us all. We spent hours navigating that treacherous territory.  Feeling accomplished, we went back to the village with our loot.  I decided to do some fisherman quests and went to the sea.  On my way there I saw these… these things! Cultists! Worshiping the… the wall! I panicked. I shot them. I screamed and cried and I was tired from playing for so long already but I was scared.  My siblings ran to help me but by the time they got there the Cultists were dead.  And something terrifying happens.  Four terrible towers that spawned the strongest enemies we had ever seen appeared across my world. I was sure they were slowing moving towards the middle. My village! My village was flood proof not the end of the world proof!  I panicked! I begged for their help! We had to get my people to a safe place. We took them down above the water pit. In the underground. We teleported them there using the steampunk’s teleporter. Some in groups, some one at a time.  We realized the towers weren’t moving. But it didn’t matter. WE destroyed my village. It was in shambles. What flood mattered now that my people lived in tiny homes carved out of rock miles below the surface?  It didn’t matter. Revenge meant nothing now. Still, I remembered what I had done to my brother’s world. I apologized and thanked him for helping save my people from what I thought was sure death.  Eventually, we beat those towers. But we weren’t prepared for what came afterwards. The Moon Lord.  He completely destroyed us. We were in awe.  We knew what we had to do. We began farming the Golem to trigger the Cultists to spawn the Towers to farm the drops for their armor. This took eternity. We would fight the final tower and let the Moon Lord kill us so we could start over.  Then, when we all bore full sets of armor and weapons, we were ready. We made a railroad track that spanned the entire world. It had boosters pushing the opposite way at the end to propel us in the other direction.  I was the mana lord. Flower was the sun lord. Max (the mad bomber) was the pet master. Din was the gun master.  We fought the Towers one last time. And we won. The Moon Lord was dead. My ruined world was saved and we were OP and ready to do anything. We had platinum to buy anything. We had materials to make everything. And most importantly, we had fun with each other.  Flower was going to built a charizard in the sky out of painted blocks as a sign of our victory.  Then… the world was corrupted. What was worse… Xen was corrupted.  Everything was gone. I had nothing. I was broken. I lost. My cobalt digging claws, my unicorn, my mana armor, my everything… gone. My people… gone.  I quit. For a long time. No more Terraria.  Until there was.  I quit for about seven months and started up again and accepted the idea that I might lose everything.  Carnie was born. The world Tight Rope was created.  This time I focused on upgrading everything. Finding everything. Finishing all the achievements. I wasn’t going to quit Terraria until I had finished Terraria. I got the Ankh Charm and the PDA. I had hallowed armor and a fur cloak.  And then it happened.  Corrupt world. Corrupt Carnie.  I was sad, but not yet broken again. I had worked hard for that little fishing punk to get my PDA… and I’ll do it again. I’ll do it all again. I’ll flood proof my town, even though Max never wanted revenge. And I’ll still play with my siblings and another sibling. The Prune Lord.  Today, corrupt files are a thing of the past. There are so many more memories I could share but there’s no more room.  Yes. Buy Terraria. Play with friends. Lose everything… and still have fun.  The Leguminati on Steam - Join now!",902.4,Recommended,"171 people found this review helpful

105600,2014-11-08 00:00:00,"Terraria is a small 2D adventure game. I will review the game in some paragraphs, and then I will give it 1-10 points.  [Gameplay] In the beggining, your quest it's to find wood, and make a shelter to survive the first night. ""The First Night""-that was the longest nigh in Terraria for me. Then, the game starts getting harder and harder. There are zombies, slimes, skeletones, Bosses and many, many other creatures. It's very interesting game! 10/10  [Crafting] Ah.The crafting system in this game is quet hard to solve.It was hard to me, I didn't know even how to make a torch. The coolest thing about the crafting system is that, you only need the items for the thing you want to craft, not like in Minecraft, where you need to put every material in some ""speacial"" position. If you're a new player, talk to the first person you see in the game. Just do it!!! 9/10 It was hard...  [Bosses] This is the coolest part of the game. Beating the bosses! So, The Bosses are made on 2 difficults, Easy and Hard. If you fight on easy difficult, don't worry. The Bosses have like 2k HP to 10k HP. They can be easly beaten up with a good armor and good weapons. IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER DON'T START WITH THE HARDMODE! JUST DON'T!!! On Hard mode, the Bosses are very hard, and If you die, you lose the game... Ex. The Eye Of Cthulhu it's on 2,8k HP on Easy, but on Hard mode, the Eyes are two and their name is ""The Twins"" The one have 20k, the other 23k HP. Good luck! 11/10  [Multiplayer] Oh my God. This is the game I can play with friends forever! It's very funny and when you and the crew get all on HardMode characters and start beating bosses, it's cool. The worstest thig is that, Terraria is made on Small, Medium and Large terrain. This is the worstest thing, not like in Minecraft, to be infinite. But it's a'ight. 8.5/10 Can be better.  [Final Review] ""Terraria"" is a very good game. Even better than Minecraft, lol. So BUY it, what're ya' waiting for? This is an big adventure in a small world, which can be played with friends. What more do you need? 9.5/10 - I highly recommend this game!  *Sorry for my bad english!*",111.3,Recommended,"284 people found this review helpful

105600,2023-08-15 00:00:00,"After playing for a bit, i can say that people who call Terraria 2D Minecraft are wrong. Terraria is better than Minecraft for several reasons. First and foremost, Terraria offers a more immersive and challenging gameplay experience. With a wide variety of enemies, bosses, and events, players are constantly engaged and on their toes. Additionally, Terraria's crafting system allows for endless possibilities, as players can combine various materials and items to create unique weapons, armour, and tools. Furthermore, Terraria has a stronger focus on exploration. The world of Terraria is massive and filled with hidden treasures, secret biomes, and dungeons to discover. This encourages players to venture out and uncover new areas, making each playthrough exciting and unpredictable. Moreover, Terraria's multiplayer aspect is seamless and highly enjoyable. Whether playing with friends or joining an online community, Terraria offers a cooperative gameplay experience like no other. Players can team up to defeat challenging bosses, build epic structures, and even engage in PvP battles. Another aspect where Terraria surpasses Minecraft is its robust and frequent updates. The developers consistently release new content, introducing exciting features, items, and events, which keeps the game fresh and enjoyable for long-time players. This commitment to regular updates ensures that players always have something new to look forward to. Lastly, Terraria's pixelated art style and retro aesthetics are visually appealing and nostalgic.  if you are wanting a game to spend hundreds of hours in, Terraria is perfect and i highly suggest trying it out with friends. Even if you have none its still fun alone.","1,760.9",Recommended,"138 people found this review helpful

You used to be able to find Dragon Armor at the bottom of pits in the Corruption. I moved to PC back in 2016, and I still remember my first time fighting the 4 pillars. This game is my absolute favorite game I've ever played.  This game tells a story, and lets you play through that story in your own way over and over again. The multiplayer is amazing, even running solo is still fun. The crafting takes you to new areas constantly, letting you discover new enemies, and find new characters to help you on your journey. And the boss fights are heart racing, plus give you amazing rewards and great satisfaction.  There really is no game like this game.

Terraria has more ores, more items, and different mechanics. That doesn't make Terraria any better or worse, just different. Minecraft is a completely different game from Terraria.

As I dive into its pixelated world, I find myself lost in a world of boundless exploration, thrilling battles, and endless creativity. It is with great pleasure that I share my experiences, as Terraria unquestionably deserves recognition as one of the greatest games on Steam.  First and foremost, Terraria's vast and diverse world is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From lush forests to treacherous caverns and sprawling deserts, every corner of this pixelated realm is teeming with secrets waiting to be discovered. The game expertly balances a sense of adventure and discovery, rewarding players with rare treasures and formidable foes at every turn. The thrill of unearthing ancient artifacts or stumbling upon hidden underground dungeons never ceases to amaze.  The depth of gameplay in Terraria is astonishing. With a seemingly infinite array of crafting options, players are only limited by their own imagination. From humble wooden abodes to towering fortresses adorned with gleaming treasures, the game allows you to shape the world as you see fit. The sense of accomplishment in building something truly remarkable is immeasurable, and sharing your creations with others online is a joy in itself.  Combat in Terraria is both exhilarating and challenging. The variety of weapons and armor available ensures that each encounter feels fresh and engaging. Whether facing off against massive bosses that test your skill and strategy or embarking on perilous journeys with friends, the game provides an adrenaline rush like no other. The cooperative multiplayer experience, whether local or online, is seamless and adds a whole new dimension of enjoyment to the game.  The artistic design of Terraria, with its charming pixelated graphics, pays homage to the classic games of the past while maintaining a unique and captivating aesthetic. The attention to detail is evident in every pixel, from the way sunlight filters through the trees to the subtle animations that breathe life into the world. The game's enchanting soundtrack further elevates the immersive experience, creating a harmonious fusion of visuals and audio that transports players to another realm entirely.  Terraria's dedicated development team, consistently delivering updates and new content over the years, deserves applause. Their commitment to enhancing the game and keeping it fresh has resulted in a loyal and passionate player community that continues to grow.

In conclusion, Terraria stands as a shining example of the brilliance that can be achieved in the realm of indie gaming. Its boundless creativity, exhilarating gameplay, and captivating world make it a masterpiece that deserves the highest accolades.

105600,2018-11-01 00:00:00,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZuRyhPjr3c  Overview Even 7 years later this two-dimensional survival game still piques my interest. I have already spent hundreds of hours mining, building, gearing, fighting massive bosses and I could easily spend hundreds more due to the thriving modding community. Even though actual developer game updates are sparse, they do still continue working on new features and fixes, as well as porting and providing updates to console and mobile versions of the game.  Although some believe Terraria derives some inspiration from Minecraft, it is important to distinguish the major differences. These differences very much so separate Terraria as its own genre-defining experience. Terraria has a large focus on gear and boss progression. In the beginning this progression is very basic and mostly boils down to digging enough to find ores to make the next tier pickaxe. Later on progression becomes much deeper with a wide selection of options.  You can focus on magic, melee, ranged, summons, and you can take advantage of all sorts of special effects like invisibility or even flight. There are certainly some items that are not quite as useful as others, but there is such a massive amount of different items to choose from that you will certainly be able to create a character that plays exactly the way you want. If you’re feeling a gap in your build, or you’ve just played through vanilla Terraria too many times already, it’s very easy to find a massive amount more variety in items through the game’s modding system.  The other important and incredibly fun part of progression in Terraria is the boss fights. You will often advance through the bosses in order alongside your gear progression. Some gear are found, or crafted from exploring the world, however bosses are usually a more important milestone for your equipment. Bosses often drop key components or fully functioning items that generally prove to be much more powerful than anything you’d be using before it. Because of this, many bosses are much more easily defeated using loot obtained from previous boss encounters.  I quite enjoy the sandbox nature of the game, however it certainly comes with a fairly annoying issue. There isn’t really a clear way to figure out how to do certain things ingame. And when these “hidden” things are required for progressing it can get frustrating. This frustration can be easily remedied by visiting the game’s community wiki. It covers pretty much anything you could want to know about the game, and the playerbase is very good at keeping it up to date. If browsing the wiki isn’t appealing to you, there are several mods out there that make for a good replacement. I would highly recommend checking out “Boss Checklist” for a quick and clear list for keeping track of what bosses you’ve defeated and which you should fight next.  You play in randomly generated worlds of limited size with varying features, but you are encouraged to bring your character across multiple different worlds throughout progression. You have options for character customization but it is quite limited as your character is just a small 2D sprite. While you are exploring your world you will be fighting off hordes of monsters, bosses, gathering loot, and building homes for yourself and your friendly NPCs. The vanilla experience easily gives hundreds of hours of play, but if you take it a step further and bring friends or find some fun mods, you will easily bring on hundreds more hours of enjoyment.  The UI is still largely the same as it’s been for many years, but it gets the job done. It’s very clear, very familiar if you’ve played Minecraft, but still easy to learn and get used to if not. There are a good amount of choices for customizing quality of life options which is appreciated. Default controls work just fine for me playing on Mouse and Keyboard, and it has good controller support as well. All controls can be easily rebinded for either control scheme.  As it’s a 2D pixel-art game I can’t speak much to the impressiveness of the graphical fidelity, however I can say that the game runs well even when there are many monsters and particles on the screen at the same time. And even though the art style is somewhat basic, they have done a good job of creating their own unique aesthetic with the theme of their monsters and bosses. I believe the majority of people would easily be able to recognize a sprite from this game, even long after they’d stopped playing it. Also to be noted, there are plenty of graphical options to customize how your game looks or help it run better.  Overall quality of the audio is good, I wish there were a bit more options for tuning volumes or being able to mute certain things, but overall it’s not a big deal. The sound effects aren’t particularly amazing and some of them can get a big jarring such as when you’re constantly firing a laser pistol and hearing constant “pew-pew-pewing” in your ears. I usually turn the effects down a bit and just enjoy the incredible music in the game instead. Terraria’s OST is certainly one of my favorites, and I’d recommend giving it a listen even if you don’t play the game.  Modding to some people tends to scare them away and think they’re going to get banned or break their game, but often that’s not even a risk. Modding in Terarria is allowed and it is very easy! There’s a plugin called “Terraria Mod Loader” that allows for very simple browsing and adding of mods to your game. I would highly recommend looking into this after you’ve played through vanilla Terraria a couple times. There is a massive amount of mods out there for this game, and there are still more being made and improved right now.  Terraria truly is a genre-defining game in my eyes, I believe it had help growing to fame riding on Minecraft’s popularity wave, but it stands strong being one of the games that many others that have come after it have pulled inspiration from. Terraria is a 2D survival game, that combines gear progression, survival, fast paced boss fights, leisurely building, and many other activities that come together for a unique experience that I haven’t seen anywhere else. For the price, I have absolutely every reason to recommend this game to anyone that might be even remotely interested. I know that even years from now I will still continue to come back and spend hundreds hours more in this wonderful game.",547.5,Recommended,"82 people found this review helpful

It not only gives you many different weapons and armors to choose from, so you can match the game to your playstyle or play the game over and over again with other loadouts. It also has much content availible for your first playthroug: the bosses, the many different enemies, golf, fishing.  I have very much enjoyed playing Terraria alone and with friends for many hours. And for those who tire of the content the Terraria has to offer, there are many amazing Mods to install with tModLoader, that can completely change the game or make some quality of life changes.

105600,2024-01-29 00:00:00,"Product received for free  Terraria - My Honest Review The game was quite fun from the start, im not gonna lie, the grind was REAL, but it was enjoyable. There is a balanced amount of combat and grind. You're always grinding to obtain better weapons, armor, or anything else of the sort, but its always for a reason, be it you're struggling to defeat a tough boss, or you just want to get stronger. Is the game difficult? it wasn't for me, but i found it quite exhilarating at times, like when i got spawned the same night i defeated the Wall of Flesh, and i was unprepared. Let me tell you, i did not win.  I have currently defeated Moonlord and am now achievement hunting (as of writing this review, 97/115] even after you're finished with the game, theres always secret seeds and the modding community is quite active and you can always go for mods like Calamity or Starlight River.",84.0,Recommended,"67 people found this review helpful

I've been addicted to this game ever since I was 8 years old, and it affected a major part of my child hood. The game itself isn't too hard, (although you can increase and decrease it's difficulty!) but is a little bit complicated. I can also definitely tell the dev's didn't take this game too seriously with its silly references, enemy and boss concepts, and just generally a goofy take at some pixel art. For $10, this game is a steal. I still haven't fully completed 100% of the achievements on my steam account despite having over 500 hours in the game. Very replayable, with a ton of secret worlds and easter eggs to discover. I might be a bit biased due to having a nostalgic connection to the game, but it seriously does deserve your time and money. 11/10.",554.3,Recommended,"61 people found this review helpful

105600,2023-03-05 00:00:00,"Welcome to the fantastic game Terraria! This game is an absolute blast and can keep you entertained for hours. It is a 2D sandbox game developed by Re-Logic available on almost every platform imaginable including PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and even mobile.  Terraria is an adventure game with a variety of different game mechanics. The game begins with your character being thrown into a procedurally generated world with nothing but a few basic tools and weapons. From there, it's up to you to explore the vast and mysterious world, find resources, craft new items, and construct your own unique structures.  One of the things I love most about Terraria is the game's extensive crafting system. There are hundreds of different items you can craft, from simple tools and weapons to magical potions and enchanted armor. The crafting system is intuitive and easy to use, but also allows for a lot of creativity and experimentation.  Another standout feature of Terraria is the game's bosses. There are dozens of different bosses to fight, each with their own unique attacks and strategies. Some of the bosses are huge and require careful planning and preparation to defeat, while others are smaller and more manageable. Each boss drops unique loot, so it's always worth defeating them.  In addition to the main adventure mode, Terraria also has a multiplayer mode that allows you to play with friends. You can explore the world together, help each other fight bosses, and construct massive structures together.  The graphics and sound in Terraria are also fantastic. The game has a charming 2D pixel style that looks great and is incredibly expressive. The music is good too, with a wide variety of different tracks that perfectly capture the adventurous spirit of the game.  Overall, Terraria is an incredibly fun and addictive game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys sandbox-style adventure games. With its extensive crafting system, challenging bosses, and multiplayer, there's always something new and exciting to discover in Terraria.",3.4,Recommended,"91 people found this review helpful

105600,2015-01-30 00:00:00,"""2D Minecraft"" - It is a thought almost everyone has had (and anyone claiming otherwise are lying to themselves), but Terraria is much more than just that, and here is why I recommend it.  Terraria's world is literally designed as a Terrarium, you start somewhere towards the middle of your world, and whether you go left or right - you will eventually stumble into an ""ocean"" with an invisible wall a little ways out. You have a couple options, build a base, and start exploring the surface, or you start mining and spelunking through the cave systems.  Terraria's surface contains a little less than a dozen different biomes for you to explore and utilize as grounds for your home base (or outpost), and you will stumble into various enemies throughout them, and even sometimes fight the biome itself (Cure the corruption/crimson, or heck even help it spread!). Be sure to build shelter for the night as monsters are prone to hunt you down. Additionally there is also the chance of events happening, such as the goblin invasion.  Throughout its underground system (which can be around 2000 blocks deep) you will find mini-dungeons, deep cavern systems and even bosses at times. And of course, we have a hell-ish biome at the very bottom filled with lava and demonic creatures.  And when you think you have done it all? Defeat the boss in the hell-biome and start a NewGame+ esque event that makes everything in your world harder - even the bosses.  So is Terraria recommended? Hell yes. For $10 (it's been on sale as low as $2 if you're on a budget) you will literally get days (or weeks!) worth of gameplay, and even more so if you have friends to play with! (Co-op always makes games better).",199.9,Recommended,"109 people found this review helpful

I found Terraria about 8 years ago, from playing the old, cracked mobile version without hard mode until playing the PC version 1.4 today. I've replayed the game countless times, since by cracking you have to restart from zero if you want to update version. I'm glad I am able to support the devs by playing it on Steam now (even though I received it for free XD).  With the contents Terraria is able to provide, Terraria is extremely underpriced to the point that I worried once whether the devs have proper meal or not (glad that's not the case). And if you ever feel that the content is not enough, you can browse community-made mods and play for another 200 hours. Terraria is fun when you play it alone, but it is even more fun with friends. If you don't have friends to play Terraria with, you can visit open servers like Pedguin and play CTF or something.  The only disadvantage of playing Terraria is that you will become addicted. Make sure you also take care of your body besides your Terraria character's stats and what not.

105600,2021-10-31 00:00:00,"I am 42.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  That's all , thank you.",5.5,Recommended,"1,210 people found this review helpful

There are pets that are cool, you can slay a lot of innocent and cute creatures like a bunny or a squirrel. The bosses are kinda hard if you did not prepare. And also it is not just some ""2D MINECRAFT"" it is way different then that. The price is worth it you should get it and your friends and family too.

105600,2020-08-22 00:00:00,"The developers of Terraria have never stopped updating the game with better graphics, better and more music and items, improvements to gameplay, and additional content for the entire lifetime of the game, despite updates being free to those who purchased the game...even as far back as its original release date. I'm convinced their self proclaimed final major update, ""Journey's End"", isn't even the end of this quality maintenance. Few games have this level of quality to begin with, but the developers are in a league of their own with their dedication to maintaining quality for their player base.  If you enjoy sandbox elements like those found in games like Minecraft, or exploration and progression like what is found in a ""Metroidvania"" game, then Terraria is a staple for your collection. The latest major update even adds a ""Journey Mode"", that lets players skip as much or as little ""grinding"" as they like, all while playing with the exact difficulty level they are comfortable with: in ""Journey Mode"", players have control over enemy strength, defense, health, and even their spawn rates.  Post Labor of Love update addendum: I actually don't like this new direction for Terraria.  They said they were done with major updates when Journey's End released, and left the game in a state that was a good balance between letting engineering players break the game, while also giving hardcore players something to sweat at. Now they're adding a bunch of difficulty changes for old content, and rebalancing a ton of things yet again, and it doesn't seem like they're even done with rebalancing things. Why do we need changes to old bosses when there's the tModLoader for booting up things like Calamity, and a whole new ""Legendary"" difficulty as part of a masochistic world seed that essentially adds new (arguably awful, but still) versions of every boss? Shouldn't it be more important to fix all of the network related race conditions that make the new promise of crossplay seem like a farce?  It's nice to have well thought out new content, like the new Shimmer liquid, but continuing to make balance changes to old content, while also regularly adding more new difficulty modifiers, for a game that seemed to be stable, just feels like the same impossible to enjoy endgame you get in online only games that never stop updating, where nothing you obtain or learn matters because it gets invalidated within weeks. The goalposts keep moving, and not in the fun and interesting way they did when they added more earlygame Summoner items or a whole new biome to bridge some of the gaps between item tiers.  Our Horseman's Blades can't summon a ton of homing pumpkins from statues anymore? Our Terrablades can't shoot into honey to store a large pile of projectiles together for one big burst? Losing these quirky emergent features wasn't worth the great new graphics for the Terrablade and related swords. I said before that all the great free updates were a blessing from a developer who didn't owe us anything, and I made it a point to mention that the longevity of the udpate cycle meant more great changes that made the game into a package ever more worthy of praise...but good things don't persist when they are constantly reconfigured, like a Ship of Theseus, until they're something else entirely. At some point, you need to stop changing old things, or else they'll be lost. SEGA made this mistake gravely with PSO2's fifth episode. Let's not repeat their error.","3,897.0",Recommended,"70 people found this review helpful

105600,2022-12-15 00:00:00,"This game saved my life.  I am 41.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",229.5,Recommended,"288 people found this review helpful

105600,2018-12-05 00:00:00,"A very NAISU (Nice) game. 8/10 Most of people think that Terraria is a survival game, but that's wrong: It's a adventure game. Let me explain this: In a survival game, the gameplay is focused in constantly making the game harder and forcing the player to search for new resources for surviving; for example, a hunger meter that depletes over time forces the player to constantly search for food, or tools that break when used too much times. In adventure games, the gameplay is focused in forcing the player to go forward and finish a main goal, in this case, defeating Cthulhu v2.0 (a.K.a. MoonLord). The game also makes the ""surviving"" easier or less important, because the main goal and the focus of the game aren't surviving, also making it a lot easier to reach the final goal.  Terraria makes the searching for resources a lot easier than most of survival games (probably because it's a 2D game), making it easy to advance in the game and of course reaching the final boss. Also, the ""corrupt biomes"" are a very interesting mechanic, motivating the players to go forward for being able to fight the evil properly, also forcing the players to go ""faster"" as the evil spreads around the world destroying everything in it's way. Invasions also are a very interesting mechanic, just imagine being building a house or trading with a NPC when suddenly you see a Goblin Army coming from west/east, or Martians using lasers and gigant robots for destroying every single life form in your world. Another thing that motivates the player to go forward, is the bosses. They are pretty strong monsters that you must beat in order to advance and getting very special rewards, such as new and powerfull materials, weapons, and armors. The OST fits the game very well; it could be better, but it's not bad, it is very good.  Thanks to you for reading, and thanks to RE-LOGIC for creating and sharing this game.  -Leo.",236.4,Recommended,"145 people found this review helpful

Even the new DST crossover boss, Deerclops looks right at home! - There's also a ton of accessories, vanities, and dyes available throughout the whole game for you to customise your character!  The music is an absolute banger. - Every epic boss fight is accompanied by their own epic music! - I personally love the Empress of Light theme so much <3 I spent quite a while to beat her Daytime form that I just vibe with it at this point hahaha!  The replay value is very high. - I've played through the game multiple times with all the different classes available and it's still fun! It's not very hard to play on Expert/Master mode, actually makes beating the boss more satisfying and rewards you with more rare loots that aren't available in Classic mode. The game also makes grinding easier once you reach certain progression stages! - The game devs really love the game and keeps updating even though it's already the last final final update, with another one coming soon called the Labor of Love update lol xD - The community also shared a lot of love for this game and has a ton of really good content mods! I personally recommend trying ""Calamity Mod"" and ""The Stars Above""!",355.0,Recommended,"64 people found this review helpful

105600,2017-12-25 00:00:00,"Terraria is probably the only game i'll ever make a review for. Why? Because this game is just so perfectly designed that every other game i've ever played just feels bland. Terraria is a 2D platformer which gets compared to minecraft often BEFORE people play it. But it is just incomparable to minecraft because it's a whole different genre. Minecraft is just about digging, surviving and building the progression is the ores you can mine. In terraria however your progression is made mostly by defeating bosses then mining, getting mob drops, fishing for loot crates, building houses for npc who can trade items/ammo/potions/etc with you, and even just exploring for chests that are all over the map. Terraria has SO MUCH content it's insane. For €9,99 it's insane how much content you get and how much fun i've gotten for my money playing like 5+ playthroughs with friends and even more solo ( because i don't even have enough friends to play this game with ). I haven't found any game that comes even close to this games perfect design and i litterally can not give a solo/friend multiplayer game less than 10/10 when i have nearly 500 hours on it when it has this little cost.  PS: terraria alone is even not all there is to it. Not a lot of people know but you can mod the hell out of terraria. These mods go from simple things like a boss checklist or making you able to stack things to 9999 instead of 999 to adding a huge amount of new well designed content ( terraria's graphics are so good for mods. People can EASELY add new bosses items, while still easy to balance because of how terraria's system works ). There are several terraria modoverhauls the add 1000+ items and 10+bosses to terraria. They are even compatible with eachother so if you want one crazy playthrough you can add like 4-5 different full overhauls to your modlist.",823.3,Recommended,"66 people found this review helpful

Pros: Cool Items Magic works in a neat way Bosses are challenging and fun to farm Has Expert mode (Even more items) Has a modding Community thats alive and well Tons of replayability and different play styles  Cons: Vanilla game once played alot can get stale Some bosses are OP Game is 32 bit. (Seriously devs add 64bit support please.) Game does not support IPV6 and as such can not host if you don't have dedicated IPV4. No Modding Support (Steam Workshop)  Overall with all the stuff in this game, It surprises me how after 400+hours i can still find things i never knew existed.  Plus with mods, It just adds even more content.  If you get this, I highly suggest you play it through to completion at least once before going to get mods.

105600,2022-06-19 00:00:00,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",341.1,Recommended,"717 people found this review helpful
