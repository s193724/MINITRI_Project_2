2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it.

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering. I hope you get a papercut the next time you lick an envelope.","3,512.7",500257106,0,Recommended

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

Die Runden dauern nicht als zu lange und wenn man keine Lust auf Ranked hat kann man gechillt Casual spielen.  Ubisoft versucht wirklich das Spiel am Leben zu halten und setzen dies auch gut in die Tat um  Das Spiel reizt einfach es gibt immer neue Spieler man möchte jede Season beweißen was man drauf hat  von mir ein dickes + für Rainbow Six Siege    and btw : THE FUTRE belong to R6S !  So gut wie keine Cheater im vergleich zu den unten genannten Spielen  eine Empfehlung Wert!   This Game got a great Future ahead!  And if you think there are many cheaters.. check out PuBg,Fortnite,Call of Duty,Cs Go  Rainbow Six Siege / Ubisoft is the best Game and you can't change the Facts.  Buy it and try it.   Pro No toxic Community Everytime Game Updates No dropshot anymore Ban System coming soon Every Year new Maps / Ops Good Graphics Good Gameplay 5Man Squad Fun Gameplay Nice Elite Skin Animation (IQ) <3 German Babe New Content every Year Okay Ingame Mic Great Ban System Nice Defend/Attack rounds  This Game is just FUN i love it.  you really really really have to try it boys/girls<3","8,781.5",46393,0,Recommended

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

And from my point of view they would make more money people would be like this  hey i wanna try this game *buys Rainbow Six Siege: Starter Edition for 14.99eur* Hey this game is actually fun *buys full edition of the game for 29.99* They would make 5eur per person who would do that so i don't understand why not add this option,"1,239.5",346350,0,Recommended

My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2024-12-06 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one.

Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2024-12-06 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.","1,301.7",221320,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead.

Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

And from my point of view they would make more money people would be like this  hey i wanna try this game *buys Rainbow Six Siege: Starter Edition for 14.99eur* Hey this game is actually fun *buys full edition of the game for 29.99* They would make 5eur per person who would do that so i don't understand why not add this option,"1,239.5",346350,0,Recommended

My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2024-12-06 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",0.1,4261253,0,Recommended
2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.

So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat (community can be toxic at times). Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead.

Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends.

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one.

More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Runs very smoothly/very well optimised. Rounds are short and snappy. No two matches are ever the same. Extremely tactical. Excellent destruction ""Realistic"". Intuitive controls. Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played. HOWEVER I would warn anyone looking to pick this up, it is hard...if you are not prepared to play properly and just run around, you will die constantly and you will not enjoy it.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates.

2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

If you brought the starter edition, your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12,500 renown each. So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Runs very smoothly/very well optimised. Rounds are short and snappy. No two matches are ever the same. Extremely tactical. Excellent destruction ""Realistic"". Intuitive controls. Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played. HOWEVER I would warn anyone looking to pick this up, it is hard...if you are not prepared to play properly and just run around, you will die constantly and you will not enjoy it.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2022-12-04 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",2.2,139322,0,Recommended
2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2024-12-06 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..

Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.

Runs very smoothly/very well optimised. Rounds are short and snappy. No two matches are ever the same. Extremely tactical. Excellent destruction ""Realistic"". Intuitive controls. Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played. HOWEVER I would warn anyone looking to pick this up, it is hard...if you are not prepared to play properly and just run around, you will die constantly and you will not enjoy it.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2022-12-04 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",2.2,139322,0,Recommended
2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one.

Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2022-12-04 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",2.2,139322,0,Recommended
2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2022-12-04 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",2.2,139322,0,Recommended
2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering. I hope you get a papercut the next time you lick an envelope.","3,512.7",500257106,0,Recommended

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

And from my point of view they would make more money people would be like this  hey i wanna try this game *buys Rainbow Six Siege: Starter Edition for 14.99eur* Hey this game is actually fun *buys full edition of the game for 29.99* They would make 5eur per person who would do that so i don't understand why not add this option,"1,239.5",346350,0,Recommended
2018-11-20 00:00:00,"A.) I love this game, I have a lot of fun playing this game. I recomond it.  B.) My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion. If you are reading this and you wrote a negetive review purly because of this, please take it down now that operation censorship has been cancelled.","1,052.1",546310,0,Recommended

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

One shot headshots (are you tired or sneaking up on players and then not being able to kill them even when you have the advantage?) 2. Wall penetration with more realistic properties 3. A company that regardless of what the pros are complaining about actually cares about the game 4. New/reworked maps 4 times a year that dont cost extra 5.

2022-12-04 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",2.2,139322,0,Recommended
2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

2022-08-07 00:00:00,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.  I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).   It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering. I hope you get a papercut the next time you lick an envelope.","3,512.7",500257106,0,Recommended

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2022-12-04 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",2.2,139322,0,Recommended
2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.  #ashkicksasses","6,483.9",274100,0,Recommended

2016-06-03 00:00:00,"EDIT: The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.  I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:  The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.  To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.  Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.  If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.  That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.  I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign""; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.  Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.  It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.  The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.  This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.  So that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",259.8,638341,0,Recommended
2017-06-19 00:00:00,"[Description] Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.  [Pros] + Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets. + No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release. + Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far + Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior. + Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher. + A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency. + You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players. + Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits. + Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together. + Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones. + Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.  - Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) - Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. - Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. - Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.  While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.",462.4,1240402,0,Recommended

I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.  You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.  Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.  The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.  Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level. Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned. Want to play ranked?

2020-12-01 00:00:00,"Oh, where to begin? Most people have a love/hate relationship with Siege. I don't feel like I ever hated this game, but there's times when I feel a bit sad that it doesn't manage to be the best it can be despite the developer's efforts. It's so close to being the definitive FPS experience, but it has quite a few pitfalls that can scare away both new and veteran players alike. So...  What is it? It's an FPS played in rounds, attackers vs defenders. You get to choose your operator (your ""hero"" character with semi-unique weapons, gadgets and abilities) and loadout each round, you get one life per round and you win by completing an objective like defusing a bomb, killing all enemy players, defending the hostage and so on. Attackers scout the map with small camera drones before the start of each round while defenders reinforce walls, set up traps and board doors and windows.  When the actual round starts, you can use your weapon, look at cameras, ping enemies and use your equipment to stop the enemies from completing their objective. You can still try to kill everyone like in most FPS games, but the team and objective play is much more important here, and running around in an open area without a care in the world will probably result in instant death. In fact, dying over and over is part of the core experience of Siege, you are forced to learn from your mistakes or keep dying without having any impact on the round.  Apart from this, there's also a lot of dynamic destruction. All bullets can penetrate ""soft"" surfaces like wood and thin walls, which makes information an extremely valuable tool in your arsenal. You can also destroy most such surfaces with specific weapons and equipment, creating new pathways and lines of sight. This is the main reason why every round truly feels different, you can say a lot of things about Siege, but lack of variety is not one of them. If you enjoy the core gameplay, you will be playing for years.  The weapons have a great feel to them, they have a lot of recoil and you can lean left and right, aim down sights, crouch, prone and run as well as climb over obstacles. When you figure out the controls it feels pretty natural and other FPS games will seem limited and unsatisfying in comparison.  When it works, it works very well. It can run in most machines despite looking pretty good graphically, I play it in 1440p 144FPS with a 1070 at almost maxed settings. So this all sounds great, why does Siege have such a bad reputation then?  First off, it has one of the steepest learning curves of any videogame out there. Even if you're already good at FPS games, Siege plays so differently that you need to re-learn a lot of things. If you're new to FPS in general...honestly, Siege is not the title to start with. It's also worth mentioning that the tutorial doesn't teach you anything about the game and is very outdated, plus the training mode is badly implemented and doesn't work properly half the time. The best way to learn is to play real rounds, watch high level players and practice your aim with an external program, which is time-consuming and frustrating. This is compounded by the fact that Siege is absolutely teeming with smurfs (high level players using secondary accounts to play in low-level lobbies) and quite a few hackers too.  There's a lot of bugs as well, probably due to the destruction physics and complexity of the title. The devs try to fix them, but every patch brings new ones. Speaking of complexity, the sheer amount of interactions means the game will always have some sort of balance issue and I can't say I'm too satisfied with how it's being handled. The in-game client is also clunky and awkward, the cosmetics are a mixed bag, most of them are ugly and generic but there's a few cool ones and definitely a lot of variety.  Playing with friends is not mandatory but heavily encouraged, you will have less toxicity, more fun rounds and a much higher win probability. Last and probably least, Siege isn't really a Tom Clancy game despite its name so if you were hoping for a sequel to Vegas 2, unfortunately Siege isn't that.  I could go into even more detail about the issues, but I think you get the picture by now. Its core mechanics are extremely solid and completely unmatched in the industry, there's no other game that offers the same gunplay and strategical depth that Siege does, which is why it's still around despite all the very obvious and serious problems it has. Winning a clutch fight is absolutely divine just like getting headshot through three walls feels like crap, it's a game with very high highs and very low lows.  Don't be scared though. Give it a try, a good, honest try with some friends and see how it goes. It might just become your next favorite game you love to hate <3","1,157.2",5201670,0,Recommended

2016-12-15 00:00:00,"Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!  I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.  Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018  ===================================================  Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.  People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them.  CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)  Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).  =====================================  Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.  Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.  Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.  Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.  Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.  Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions.  Running Outside To kill ------ Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!  ============================  I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!  Update on January 3rd:  Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:  We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016.  We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.  Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/)  Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.  Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.  Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.  Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.  That's it for the January 2018!  ============================  I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

2018-08-07 00:00:00,"This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.  UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators) for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)  Summary: good game boys, get it now",658.3,333161,0,Recommended

2024-12-06 00:00:00,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.  There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.  More tips: -There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. -To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. -When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. -If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.",0.1,4261253,0,Recommended
2020-02-11 00:00:00,"Initially I started playing Rainbow Six Siege back when it was released. I absolutely loved the game, especially as a fan of competitive shooters like CS:GO. I have since then came back to Rainbow six Siege multiple times as it's just a blast with friends.  Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks. At the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense, while the attackers get time to scout the level, and see how the defenders are setup. Both Attackers and defenders have multiple operators(52 total at the moment of writing) that can be bought with points that are earned in-game. Each operator has it's own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style. The cool part about this, is how in-depth everything is. All these weapons, gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team. Not only this, but it's just awesome to zip line on buildings, blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps.  The graphics are good, especially for an older game and sound design is amazing. Sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial.  So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Yes ofcourse! But you do have to like competitive shooters. However, good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like CS:GO, as it's more about strategy.",435.9,328170,0,Recommended

Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. -Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person. -Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

2017-11-04 00:00:00,"I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?  Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.  After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.  Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill.  The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.  As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did.  So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot",683.7,801751,0,Recommended

Completely unforgiving. Tailored for all skill levels. Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects). Great community. Great Gunplay. Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead. Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish. Very, very good tutorials. The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.  Cons: Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode). Some collision problems with some of the maps. Price.   All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played.

2022-02-03 00:00:00,"Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.  For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.  First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.  There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.  The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.  And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.  Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.",46.2,152253219,0,Recommended

2016-11-11 00:00:00,"Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).  It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides ""scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too"" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing. But it's all now in the past, thankfully.  It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.  Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.  Pros: - since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience; - every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy; - balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable; - every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage; - a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying); - there's always a chance to win even when you think ""it's gg"". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.  Neutral: - 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death; - 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira); - only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).  Cons: - ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage; - netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it; - peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP; - bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating; - bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with); - if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.  This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.  Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends.
