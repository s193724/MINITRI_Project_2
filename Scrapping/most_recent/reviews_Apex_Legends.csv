2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s. Titanfall 3 died for this. Titanfall was, and still is, much better than this heap of garbage.)","2,021.8",4452137,0,Recommended

2021-01-04 00:00:00,"I am 41 years old and probably one of the oldest players on Apex Legends servers. I have to say I enjoy this game a lot. I have been playing FPS games since the original Doom, and I played Unreal Tournament (UT) and Quake 3 a lot when they were launched on 1999. To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS. This is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation, good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay. I am married with children and still try to play a few games every night since I found this gem. And best part, it is FREE!! You should definitely give it a try.",718.0,126067167,0,Recommended

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money? I sure don't.",246.8,6051550,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty?

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty?

These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell.

High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s. Titanfall 3 died for this. Titanfall was, and still is, much better than this heap of garbage.)","2,021.8",4452137,0,Recommended

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban.

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update?

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

The movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.  The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

They will still meet max level players in a normal match. Then this game's server is really trash tbh. I always suffer from lagging and suddenly disconnecting to the game while playing. Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane. Anyways, don't even give this game a try, you will first get addicted to the game but afterwards, you will be bored and also annoyed to the game because of the trash can match making system and also the cheaters.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

The movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.  The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events.

And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.  It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money? I sure don't.",246.8,6051550,0,Recommended

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban.

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

Ingredients:  1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie.  Directions:  1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",20.1,750268128,0,Recommended
2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.  I want to hear other peoples experience on this game and their recommendations on what could be better. Stay kind and happy holidays!  Carni 24/12/2023","2,398.0",6072144,0,Recommended

2023-01-23 00:00:00,"EDIT: This review did not age well. Mobile got sacrificed at the EA altar and its lifeblood was squeezed into the dry, starving mouths of PC and console. As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about. Thank you EA. You truly have the reverse Midas touch, where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo.",677.0,158,0,Recommended
2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

2023-04-22 00:00:00,"I want to continue to love this game, the controls, movement & weapons are excellent and overall gameplay is super enjoyable... but the matchmaking will ensure you're never actually having fun. It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.  It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous. And as of now (April of 2023) there have been six collection events since the start of the year. SIX.","1,114.6",5422233,0,Recommended

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you.

2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system.

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty?

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s. Titanfall 3 died for this. Titanfall was, and still is, much better than this heap of garbage.)","2,021.8",4452137,0,Recommended

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.  It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended
2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.   - Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth.

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

I have been playing FPS games since the original Doom, and I played Unreal Tournament (UT) and Quake 3 a lot when they were launched on 1999. To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS. This is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation, good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me.

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

The movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.  The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended
2024-11-19 00:00:00,"Product received for free  This game started very well but now it's a completely disaster. First it's very unfriendly to the rookies. They will still meet max level players in a normal match. Then this game's server is really trash tbh. I always suffer from lagging and suddenly disconnecting to the game while playing. Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane. Anyways, don't even give this game a try, you will first get addicted to the game but afterwards, you will be bored and also annoyed to the game because of the trash can match making system and also the cheaters.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done!

2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.   - Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban.

There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

The movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.  The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended
2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.   - Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth.

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf.

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

The movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.  The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

They will still meet max level players in a normal match. Then this game's server is really trash tbh. I always suffer from lagging and suddenly disconnecting to the game while playing. Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.  It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended

With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"It's absolutely impossible to enjoy Apex Legends!  The Good Honestly, the core gameplay of Apex Legends has to be one of the best games out right now. The weapons, the characters, the movement mechanics, everything is deep and enjoyable. If it's all you look at, and when they truly feel balanced, it really is a great game at it's core, but it's potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team.  Horrific match making, there is no such thing as casual play. I can't understand it, what am I even playing? I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks.  It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.  I don't want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no-mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs. I don't want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and I just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50/50 shot at who gets a down first. The game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win, or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight.  There's so much ugly about this game, the toxic player base, the hacking, the over-powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins, the overpriced store items, the audio, the list is endless.  Some of my favorite streamers, and yours', play this game and even for them it's a brutal grind but sometimes it's impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun. The reality is very far from that, those guys play 8-10 hours every day for years to get that good. Playing this game for the first time, or even casually is absolutely impossible. A great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions.",322.5,6805490,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s. Titanfall 3 died for this. Titanfall was, and still is, much better than this heap of garbage.)","2,021.8",4452137,0,Recommended

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money? I sure don't.",246.8,6051550,0,Recommended

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it.

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",20.1,750268128,0,Recommended
2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.  I want to hear other peoples experience on this game and their recommendations on what could be better. Stay kind and happy holidays!  Carni 24/12/2023","2,398.0",6072144,0,Recommended

2023-01-23 00:00:00,"EDIT: This review did not age well. Mobile got sacrificed at the EA altar and its lifeblood was squeezed into the dry, starving mouths of PC and console. As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about. Thank you EA. You truly have the reverse Midas touch, where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo.",677.0,158,0,Recommended
2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

2023-04-22 00:00:00,"I want to continue to love this game, the controls, movement & weapons are excellent and overall gameplay is super enjoyable... but the matchmaking will ensure you're never actually having fun. It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.  It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended
2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"It's absolutely impossible to enjoy Apex Legends!  The Good Honestly, the core gameplay of Apex Legends has to be one of the best games out right now. The weapons, the characters, the movement mechanics, everything is deep and enjoyable. If it's all you look at, and when they truly feel balanced, it really is a great game at it's core, but it's potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team.  Horrific match making, there is no such thing as casual play. I can't understand it, what am I even playing? I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks.  It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.  I don't want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no-mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs. I don't want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and I just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50/50 shot at who gets a down first. The game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win, or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight.  There's so much ugly about this game, the toxic player base, the hacking, the over-powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins, the overpriced store items, the audio, the list is endless.  Some of my favorite streamers, and yours', play this game and even for them it's a brutal grind but sometimes it's impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun. The reality is very far from that, those guys play 8-10 hours every day for years to get that good. Playing this game for the first time, or even casually is absolutely impossible.

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf.

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

They will still meet max level players in a normal match. Then this game's server is really trash tbh. I always suffer from lagging and suddenly disconnecting to the game while playing. Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.  It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended

With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.   - Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth.

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"It's absolutely impossible to enjoy Apex Legends!  The Good Honestly, the core gameplay of Apex Legends has to be one of the best games out right now. The weapons, the characters, the movement mechanics, everything is deep and enjoyable. If it's all you look at, and when they truly feel balanced, it really is a great game at it's core, but it's potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team.  Horrific match making, there is no such thing as casual play. I can't understand it, what am I even playing? I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks.  It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.  I don't want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no-mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs. I don't want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and I just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50/50 shot at who gets a down first. The game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win, or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight.  There's so much ugly about this game, the toxic player base, the hacking, the over-powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins, the overpriced store items, the audio, the list is endless.  Some of my favorite streamers, and yours', play this game and even for them it's a brutal grind but sometimes it's impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun. The reality is very far from that, those guys play 8-10 hours every day for years to get that good. Playing this game for the first time, or even casually is absolutely impossible. A great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions.",322.5,6805490,0,Recommended

If you give EA/Respawn any money after these recent events then you're part of the problem, actual scum run this game and it's a damn shame with the potential of this gem of a game.  Respawn has made a statement addressing multiple key issues and saying that they are the priorities for the dev team such as: cheaters, quality of life changes, etc. I will NOT change this review to positive until they follow through and deliver what they promise, there has been too many times where we were told things are being done only for no word on the matter for months/years.","2,817.3",11319,0,Recommended

2022-07-20 00:00:00,"The Best Battle Royale on the Market with some Faults  Pros: + Smoothest Movement + Satisfying gunplay + Every animation & sound effect is so distinct, you can tell where and what is coming towards you. + Stressful but rewarding final circles in Ranked + Crossplay with friends on consoles (Nintendo Switch players are free kills) + Easy to complete battle pass within a month of playtime. + Beautiful maps such as Olympus & Stormpoint to the sweaty competitive maps, World's Edge & King's Canyon.  Neutral: - Shares the same universe as Titanfall but the lore is okayish. - I honestly think Apex has the worst cosmetic team next to Halo Infinite. Some of them are really just nice but exclusive to the battle pass or collection events. If you do find a really good skin that isn't a recolor of the default model, be ready to shell out 18/35/50 dollars up to 160+. It's honestly a cycle with this game, you get 3 seasons of good skins and 3 seasons of mediocre or trash skins. - If you don't like the battle royale mode, there is a lite economy round based 3v3 mode to mess around in called Arenas. - Limited time game modes like Control (Domination if you ever played COD) should be in the base game. - Like every modern game today, the matchmaking system pits you against or with pro players, new players, or the average 2 hour free time guy. - Since the game is free to play, there's lootboxes, completely random. Some get Heirlooms Shards (0.2% chance of dropping) early on, while it took me 800 hours. Heirloom Shards are for melee weapons or prestige Legends skins that do not affect gameplay. There is a bunch of crap in the lootboxes to further your chances of not getting what you want. - Characters aside from the default roster need to be bought with in game currency or real money. They also cannot be tested in the firing range.   - Somehow there's a game breaking bug every season. - Squads/Quads (teams of 4) doesn't exist, leaving that one friend all alone while the rest play Trios. Nor is there a true solos mode. - Servers are really bad causing desyc/bullets aren't registering, crashing, or disconnects. - Enemy footsteps sometimes doesn't work. - Joke of an esport; the recent ALGS 2022 had players dc, visas denied, teams teleporting across the map and dying to their deaths, or players gettings covid - forcing teams to play as a duo instead as a trio. The tournament organizers didn't want to restart despite all these problems. Also they didn't even play on LAN?? The event was connected to the nearest server. Even the custom matches for pros to scrim in, didn't work for a while. - The balancing or design team whatever you want to call them is very questionable. You have 2 Legends, Seer & Valkyrie dominating tournaments without a single nerf in sight meanwhile, Lifeline's old shield passive was reworked into a new Legend, we have two of the same character now. Which leads onto my next point, a few characters share the same ability just slightly different. Sooner or later the game will become a massive unbalancing mess than it already is. Then finally, some Legends that need a buff stay untouched for a very long time. - Easy anti-cheat would sometimes blue screen my computer or crash my game back to the desktop once in a blue moon. - The lack of a spectating system without going into match or a dedicated match history.    - ImperialHal, Reps, Albralelie, HisWattson, Apryze, Sweetdreams, Hardecki, Nafen, Taisheen, Mande, sYnceD, Monsoon, Rogue   - Aceu, Stormen, Taxi2g, Faide, Crylix   - ChaoticMuch, Verhulst, Daltoosh, Staynaughty, Knoqd, Pandxrz, Snip3down, Thekine   - Rag Tagg, Lej, Emerald Gemerald & the butt load of vtubers on Apex   - TheGamingMerchant & Mokeysniper   - Cheetah, Tooncraft, Hoxdolum, & dopatwo","3,434.8",2841640,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s. Titanfall 3 died for this. Titanfall was, and still is, much better than this heap of garbage.)","2,021.8",4452137,0,Recommended

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it.

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous.

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended
2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.   - Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks.  It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.  I don't want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no-mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs. I don't want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and I just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50/50 shot at who gets a down first. The game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win, or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight.  There's so much ugly about this game, the toxic player base, the hacking, the over-powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins, the overpriced store items, the audio, the list is endless.  Some of my favorite streamers, and yours', play this game and even for them it's a brutal grind but sometimes it's impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun. The reality is very far from that, those guys play 8-10 hours every day for years to get that good. Playing this game for the first time, or even casually is absolutely impossible. A great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions.",322.5,6805490,0,Recommended

Respawn has made a statement addressing multiple key issues and saying that they are the priorities for the dev team such as: cheaters, quality of life changes, etc. I will NOT change this review to positive until they follow through and deliver what they promise, there has been too many times where we were told things are being done only for no word on the matter for months/years.","2,817.3",11319,0,Recommended

2022-07-20 00:00:00,"The Best Battle Royale on the Market with some Faults  Pros: + Smoothest Movement + Satisfying gunplay + Every animation & sound effect is so distinct, you can tell where and what is coming towards you. + Stressful but rewarding final circles in Ranked + Crossplay with friends on consoles (Nintendo Switch players are free kills) + Easy to complete battle pass within a month of playtime. + Beautiful maps such as Olympus & Stormpoint to the sweaty competitive maps, World's Edge & King's Canyon.  Neutral: - Shares the same universe as Titanfall but the lore is okayish. - I honestly think Apex has the worst cosmetic team next to Halo Infinite. Some of them are really just nice but exclusive to the battle pass or collection events. If you do find a really good skin that isn't a recolor of the default model, be ready to shell out 18/35/50 dollars up to 160+. It's honestly a cycle with this game, you get 3 seasons of good skins and 3 seasons of mediocre or trash skins. - If you don't like the battle royale mode, there is a lite economy round based 3v3 mode to mess around in called Arenas. - Limited time game modes like Control (Domination if you ever played COD) should be in the base game. - Like every modern game today, the matchmaking system pits you against or with pro players, new players, or the average 2 hour free time guy. - Since the game is free to play, there's lootboxes, completely random. Some get Heirlooms Shards (0.2% chance of dropping) early on, while it took me 800 hours. Heirloom Shards are for melee weapons or prestige Legends skins that do not affect gameplay. There is a bunch of crap in the lootboxes to further your chances of not getting what you want. - Characters aside from the default roster need to be bought with in game currency or real money. They also cannot be tested in the firing range.   - Somehow there's a game breaking bug every season. - Squads/Quads (teams of 4) doesn't exist, leaving that one friend all alone while the rest play Trios. Nor is there a true solos mode. - Servers are really bad causing desyc/bullets aren't registering, crashing, or disconnects. - Enemy footsteps sometimes doesn't work. - Joke of an esport; the recent ALGS 2022 had players dc, visas denied, teams teleporting across the map and dying to their deaths, or players gettings covid - forcing teams to play as a duo instead as a trio. The tournament organizers didn't want to restart despite all these problems. Also they didn't even play on LAN?? The event was connected to the nearest server. Even the custom matches for pros to scrim in, didn't work for a while. - The balancing or design team whatever you want to call them is very questionable. You have 2 Legends, Seer & Valkyrie dominating tournaments without a single nerf in sight meanwhile, Lifeline's old shield passive was reworked into a new Legend, we have two of the same character now. Which leads onto my next point, a few characters share the same ability just slightly different. Sooner or later the game will become a massive unbalancing mess than it already is. Then finally, some Legends that need a buff stay untouched for a very long time. - Easy anti-cheat would sometimes blue screen my computer or crash my game back to the desktop once in a blue moon. - The lack of a spectating system without going into match or a dedicated match history.    - ImperialHal, Reps, Albralelie, HisWattson, Apryze, Sweetdreams, Hardecki, Nafen, Taisheen, Mande, sYnceD, Monsoon, Rogue   - Aceu, Stormen, Taxi2g, Faide, Crylix   - ChaoticMuch, Verhulst, Daltoosh, Staynaughty, Knoqd, Pandxrz, Snip3down, Thekine   - Rag Tagg, Lej, Emerald Gemerald & the butt load of vtubers on Apex   - TheGamingMerchant & Mokeysniper   - Cheetah, Tooncraft, Hoxdolum, & dopatwo","3,434.8",2841640,0,Recommended

2024-12-22 00:00:00,"OK. I can't believe i'm writing this. Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s.

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money?

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

As a result, we now have TDM, character class overhauls, a much better firing range, etc... I'm actually very pleasantly surprised. Let's hope EA doesn't yank on Respawn's leash and let them keep on improving the game.  Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about.

2020-11-05 00:00:00,"♦️ Apex Legends Apex Legends is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, Apex Legends proves it is here to stay.  Monetization → Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous. And as of now (April of 2023) there have been six collection events since the start of the year. SIX.","1,114.6",5422233,0,Recommended

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended
2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.   - Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"It's absolutely impossible to enjoy Apex Legends!  The Good Honestly, the core gameplay of Apex Legends has to be one of the best games out right now. The weapons, the characters, the movement mechanics, everything is deep and enjoyable. If it's all you look at, and when they truly feel balanced, it really is a great game at it's core, but it's potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team.  Horrific match making, there is no such thing as casual play. I can't understand it, what am I even playing? I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks.  It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.  I don't want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no-mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs. I don't want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and I just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50/50 shot at who gets a down first. The game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win, or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight.  There's so much ugly about this game, the toxic player base, the hacking, the over-powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins, the overpriced store items, the audio, the list is endless.  Some of my favorite streamers, and yours', play this game and even for them it's a brutal grind but sometimes it's impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun. The reality is very far from that, those guys play 8-10 hours every day for years to get that good. Playing this game for the first time, or even casually is absolutely impossible. A great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions.",322.5,6805490,0,Recommended

2022-07-20 00:00:00,"The Best Battle Royale on the Market with some Faults  Pros: + Smoothest Movement + Satisfying gunplay + Every animation & sound effect is so distinct, you can tell where and what is coming towards you. + Stressful but rewarding final circles in Ranked + Crossplay with friends on consoles (Nintendo Switch players are free kills) + Easy to complete battle pass within a month of playtime. + Beautiful maps such as Olympus & Stormpoint to the sweaty competitive maps, World's Edge & King's Canyon.  Neutral: - Shares the same universe as Titanfall but the lore is okayish. - I honestly think Apex has the worst cosmetic team next to Halo Infinite. Some of them are really just nice but exclusive to the battle pass or collection events. If you do find a really good skin that isn't a recolor of the default model, be ready to shell out 18/35/50 dollars up to 160+. It's honestly a cycle with this game, you get 3 seasons of good skins and 3 seasons of mediocre or trash skins. - If you don't like the battle royale mode, there is a lite economy round based 3v3 mode to mess around in called Arenas. - Limited time game modes like Control (Domination if you ever played COD) should be in the base game. - Like every modern game today, the matchmaking system pits you against or with pro players, new players, or the average 2 hour free time guy. - Since the game is free to play, there's lootboxes, completely random. Some get Heirlooms Shards (0.2% chance of dropping) early on, while it took me 800 hours. Heirloom Shards are for melee weapons or prestige Legends skins that do not affect gameplay. There is a bunch of crap in the lootboxes to further your chances of not getting what you want. - Characters aside from the default roster need to be bought with in game currency or real money. They also cannot be tested in the firing range.   - Somehow there's a game breaking bug every season. - Squads/Quads (teams of 4) doesn't exist, leaving that one friend all alone while the rest play Trios. Nor is there a true solos mode. - Servers are really bad causing desyc/bullets aren't registering, crashing, or disconnects. - Enemy footsteps sometimes doesn't work. - Joke of an esport; the recent ALGS 2022 had players dc, visas denied, teams teleporting across the map and dying to their deaths, or players gettings covid - forcing teams to play as a duo instead as a trio. The tournament organizers didn't want to restart despite all these problems. Also they didn't even play on LAN?? The event was connected to the nearest server. Even the custom matches for pros to scrim in, didn't work for a while. - The balancing or design team whatever you want to call them is very questionable. You have 2 Legends, Seer & Valkyrie dominating tournaments without a single nerf in sight meanwhile, Lifeline's old shield passive was reworked into a new Legend, we have two of the same character now. Which leads onto my next point, a few characters share the same ability just slightly different. Sooner or later the game will become a massive unbalancing mess than it already is. Then finally, some Legends that need a buff stay untouched for a very long time. - Easy anti-cheat would sometimes blue screen my computer or crash my game back to the desktop once in a blue moon. - The lack of a spectating system without going into match or a dedicated match history.    - ImperialHal, Reps, Albralelie, HisWattson, Apryze, Sweetdreams, Hardecki, Nafen, Taisheen, Mande, sYnceD, Monsoon, Rogue   - Aceu, Stormen, Taxi2g, Faide, Crylix   - ChaoticMuch, Verhulst, Daltoosh, Staynaughty, Knoqd, Pandxrz, Snip3down, Thekine   - Rag Tagg, Lej, Emerald Gemerald & the butt load of vtubers on Apex   - TheGamingMerchant & Mokeysniper   - Cheetah, Tooncraft, Hoxdolum, & dopatwo","3,434.8",2841640,0,Recommended

2021-04-18 00:00:00,"IS IT WORTH PLAYING ?   Honestly, Yes! I played this game when it first released. That would be approximately 2 years back. And this game is flat out the best Battle Royale, FPS, and overall game out there. Never once was I bored... frustrated? -yes... irritated? -100% ... bored? -NEVER! The fact that you have abilities and passive its feels like if... Overwatch and Counter Strike had a baby, and Valorant and PUBG had a baby and in some way the product of the two banged and gave birth to a baby.. then that would be Apex Legends.  Lots of gun inspiration and character inspiration comes from the Titanfall games, mostly because the game kind of plays itself in the Titanfall Universe, which I haven't really played so I can't give much information on how similar they are or anything like that.  Like most recent games, Apex legends also has its own called .  And not to forget , yes, this game has it too, and I am not going to sit here and rant on how good or bad they are. I would rather like to talk about how they are different from others. Its system and all is just like any other lootbox system, something that might differ from other lootbox systems is, you will never get a repeated item, but if you own an item and you end up reopening the same item in the future , then in place of getting a repeat you are rewarded with crafting materials (How much of it depends on the Tier of the repeated item), which if collected, lets you unlock default skins or sometimes, buy a weapon skin/ Legend skin from events.( Which in general costs in-game currency )      1. Shooting 2. Movement 3. Healing 4. Abilities [for all legends] :     The game for the most party rewards an aggressive playstyle, and has wonderful movement mechanics. Reaching a high movement skill cap in conjunction with a good aggressive playstyle has certain benefits and will probably win you many fights, but in the end it is a Battle Royale and you are at risk of getting 3rd partied. A good balance between knowing what fight to take and when to be aggressive and to hold position and angles will overall make you a better player and give your better results. [ Though honestly playing 100% aggressive is VERY fun ]     In terms of graphics yes it is good visually, and it runs on the Source engine which allowed for couple of mechanics to come in like B-hopping, which was soon sort of patched out and others like getting a short speed boost while strafing in air, and couple more.  Not all Legends are of equal Height and Width, meaning each and every Legend has a different hitbox. Some are small and some are large. As of 2021, smaller Legends take extra damage [5% extra incoming damage - Harder to hit ] and similarly larger Legends take less[15% reduced incoming damage - Easier to hit].  The Audio is not entirely the best, sometimes its just weird, this is honestly one of the places I feel the game developers need to seriously focus their attention at.                                  And I would Play 500 times And I would game 500 more Just to be the man who rocks a thousand wins and probably a couple more.

Let me just preface that I REALLY love Apex Legends and have played it since launch (Console switch to PC) I have spent GODLY amounts of $$$ into this game because I love it so much. So... Why am I not recommending it? That's because Apex Legends is a shell of the game it once was. a once beloved game by a respected developer turned into a Soulless Cash-grab. Apex legends is the only game I have ever played that made me wish loot-boxes were still the industry norm. With the changes to legends making certain characters OVER OP (Lifeline) to ridiculous metas (Lifeline, Newcastle, MASTIFF.) All the joy of hopping into a match with your friends and playing either quick play or comp have been eviscerated like that cousin you hate. By far the WORST change to happen in Apex is the battlepass changes and the store revamp. Remember when Heirlooms were $128 when a new one was released? well now you can get a CSGO Karambit Knife for $200!!! Oh and no new Legend specific Heirlooms or Heirloom skins, just recolors after recolors for the same price as the original. whats different? nothing, nothings different. A new animation, banner, and emote. that's it. Apex Legends is still fun, hopping in with friends CAN be enjoyable for a period before the meta makes you want to go buy milk and never return. Overall, it's sad to see a game I played for so long die because of corporate greed. I'll still play the game, but not nearly as often as I used to. And honesty? I think it's time we say goodbye to the Apex of old. because this isn't Apex Legends. its an online retailer for skins and money burn piles.",582.5,7112175,0,Recommended

2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Day 1 player... Over 2,000 hours in this game... Even more hours on titanfall... I used to play this for hours on end and have so much fun. The movement, the clutches, the gun-play is the best out there for a BR in my opinion, BUT...  I can honestly say, I'm out. I'm frustrated. I'm Uninstalling. I can't do it anymore. Player count is at an all time low, 53% of all players have left this game in a month and it's not hard to figure out why:  - Ranked above platinum is littered with cheaters, from soft wall hacks to straight up aim-bot. every. match. These cheaters are well established accounts. The soft wall hacks are far more prolific than anyone is letting on.  - Solo que is an absolute nightmare, if you're not in a 3-stack, good luck getting anyone to comm, and if they do, they're toxic as hell. Champ squad will be a full 3 stack of pro players. You will not leave this game feeling good, just angry and depressed. Sure, solo que pubs then? Nah your brain-dead teammate will solo push a team, tell you it's your fault, then rage quit the match. Want to play solos? Too bad they removed both solos and duos.  - Servers are horrible. High ping and if they fail while you're in a ranked match, you get a penalty for their ♥♥♥♥ servers.  - EA only cares about $$, the greed is absolutely off the charts. No need to fix cheaters, exploits, teaming or holes in the map, just push a new skin and battlepass! They're obviously just trying to milk the loyal fan base dry before the game dies entirely, which is very close to happening.  - No reg bullets, certain guns are overpowered, no footstep audio (still?), aim-assist is still overpowered despite the recent nerf.  And what does EA do? Nothing. Just Re-skin more heirlooms, put out half baked ideas, ""update"" the market to push out skins and ignore the player base that made this game great in the first place. I see some posts about bans and anti-cheat but whatever y'all are doing, its getting worse.  You want to check their twitter for an update? No update, no addressing cheaters, just arguing with an e-sports team about the pronouns of a fictional character!!!!!  All of this I could forgive if the cheating just wasn't so prolific. What's the point? Why waste your time? The cheats are off the charts, you don't even stand a chance. The cheaters aren't even trying to hide it either because there is NO PENALTY.  (P.s. Titanfall 3 died for this. Titanfall was, and still is, much better than this heap of garbage.)","2,021.8",4452137,0,Recommended

2024-10-18 00:00:00,"I first started playing Apex Legends back when it had just launched, before Season 1 had even been released. Back when it was still being developed by the original Respawn team. It was a fun game, breaking past limitations of the FPS genre, creating an engaging narrative, and inventing groundbreaking mechanics that would become FPS game staples.  However, Apex Legends is no longer that same game. The team at Respawn Entertainment had a vision for a fun, long-lasting, live service title, while out of touch EA executives clearly had another vision. One that was more profitable. Overtime, Respawn's top talent and leadership was removed, forced out, or transferred away.  Current Respawn is a husk of its former self. It is no longer being developed by the original passionate team. Here is the classic Ship of Theseus Paradox, in the form of a game studio. If you replace every employee at a game studio, is it the same game studio? I would argue no. Modern Respawn is no longer the Respawn Entertainment that built the original Apex Legends or Titanfall.  Modern Apex Legends is nothing like the original. The ground breaking, fast paced, and fun gameplay of the original seasons has been replaced an over-abundance of content, bloated systems, and dull gameplay. Over-monetization and gotcha mechanics have made it not worth the money to support monetarily. Cheating has always been an issue for online games, but modern Respawn is more focused on squeezing money out of their player-base then fixing the cheating issue.  I had not played for a few years after getting frustrated with the slow destruction of the game. I tried coming back to the game for a few weeks, only to find that the issues had become so bad that I would have quit the game after a few hours and never come back, if I had not had so many fond memories of the original seasons and was trying to chase the high of those memories. I believe this is the trap that the modern player-base has fallen into. I don't believe that new players are actually playing the game anymore. It's a bunch of veteran players, from past seasons when the game was in a better state, continuing to play because they already invested so much time into the game and are caught up in a delusional hope that Respawn will suddenly turn the ship around.  I do not recommend this game at all and strongly suggest that users go play games that are more respectful of your time and entertainment. For example, The Finals by Embark Studios where you can buy reasonably priced yet cool cosmetics, play fun events, and receive actually good updates. Oh, and as an added bonus they actually listen to their community, adding requested cosmetics, features, and balance changes. They also legitimately admit their mistakes instead of back tracking then slowly unback-tracking over time.    Also as a postscript, EA's more recent public patents seem to indicate that they are using an AI behind the scenes to match make players, but not the normal kind of matchmaking. EA has said on these patents that they are using an AI matchmaking system to keep players engaged for longer periods of time (so trying to addict you) and get you to spend more money. The AI only cares about these two things. It will match players who haven't spent money against players who have in ways that make the people spending money actually have a better time and get more wins. Also another patent that EA filed is all about using a behind the scenes AI to keep players engaged by modifying ""gameplay."" How? By modifying bullet tragedies, damage, loot placement, and everything about the game to keep players engaged.  EA didn't say which games they were using these patented systems on and sometimes said that they didn't use these systems at all, but then back-tracked and admitted that some of their biggest games with the highest player counts were in fact using at-least portions of these systems.  Tell me, do you really trust EA and Respawn Entertainment not to use AI systems to modify your game so that its no longer raw skill, but you're being matched against players who will beat you and that the AI system will modify your gameplay to ensure that you loose just to keep you engaged and spending money? I sure don't.",246.8,6051550,0,Recommended

2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Wanted to wait until 1000 hours to write anything, though admittedly I knew for the last ~500 where this was going to end up. I LOVE this game at its core. The actual game loop, the gamePLAY - wonderful stuff. Would literally never get old IF the matchmaking were...different(?) Stop me if you've heard this one before...  To preface this, I want to address the point delusional EA worshipers constantly throw back at my particular critique, before anyone even says it this time: Not everyone has the will, let alone desire, to browse Reddit forums in an effort to find similarly skilled randoms to play with in order to simulate a balanced matchmaking system. People on the internet are weird + I'm not a social butterfly. Sifting through all that ♥♥♥♥ is not for me and I don't think that's a reasonable expectation to have of your playerbase.  What I WANT to do is play with my actual friends, who have historically been willing, to their credit, to endure many sessions with me. Those sessions typically involve(d) them being instantly one-clipped to start an engagement by players they NEVER should've been facing in pubs, let alone ranked, and leaving me to attempt to 1v2/3, again, MOST of the time. I'm historically a 2-ish KD player at my best; I'm solid at the game, but I'm simply not capable of consistently beating Master and Predator-tier 3-stacks who populate our lobbies, especially not in a numbers disadvantage. But that's how it goes. Matchmaking sees my relatively functional skill level, ignores my friends' substantially lower skill potential, and away we go for 12 straight crushing defeats before someone decides this is a waste of time. And I can't fault them! It is absolutely a waste of time to just get steamrolled over and over and over because the game used your twitching corpse to fill ultra-high MMR lobbies instead of offering any kind of balanced experience. And imagine how much worse it is for my friends who are already weak players, trying to come back after extended breaks from the game. Forget about it.  I've been on hiatus from Apex for the better part of a calendar year now, but every once in a while I get the urge to jump back in, thinking SURELY this time it'll be different. I read the other day a post from EA/Respawn (whatever) from the beginning of 2022 describing the ""previous"" matchmaking system in detail (which I never expected them to ever do) and going pretty vaguely through their alleged plans to rework and revamp said system. They even admitted that the longstanding format, as everyone suspected, was simply matching the entire party to the best player's skill level for the purpose of finding an ""appropriate"" lobby. But supposedly their preliminary testing data for this new approach supported a more *gasp* balanced matchmaking experience for the majority of skill levels, and they intended to phase out the ""highest skill"" matchmaking that had made the game so cancerous for so long. I figured, ♥♥♥♥, this was almost a year ago! Surely by NOW it's fully implemented and I can actually rally the lads once more for the ultimate revenge round! Finally I can quench my thirst for this awesome but unplayable game! Then I browse the Steam discussions and some Reddit threads. By all accounts the matchmaking is worse than ever before, with all evidence pointing to some unannounced matchmaking change taking place over the summer. This is the overwhelming consensus online, even factoring out the people who are obviously just irrationally mad or calling everyone a cheater. I firmly believe based on my thousand hours in this game that the cheaters, while they totally do exist, are almost all hanging out in high-level ranked games. It's not common to find cheaters in pubs. However, I can totally understand how newer/less competent players would automatically assume they're facing cheaters when they're getting insta-beamed by players who should NEVER HAVE BEEN IN THEIR LOBBIES.  It's really, really sad to waste a game like this because of something so seemingly fixable. At least from a layman's perspective, why not just matchmake based on the AVERAGE skill level of your team? In our case, that would, in theory, largely squeeze out the top-1% players while also allowing in some people closer to my friends' level. They'd still have a challenge, but it'd be so much fairer for them. I would have a mixed experience, but much better chance of carrying a fight against a slightly stronger team if necessary. Let me be clear in that I do not by any means expect to be able to like, pub-stomp the way Preds do for views or some ♥♥♥♥. I want a challenge that my friends can REASONABLY hold up against, at least SOME of the time. And don't give me that goofy BS about the playerbase being too small to support the kind of solution I'm describing. There's over 120,000 people playing on Steam as I write this on a random Tuesday.  It just sucks. This is far and away my favorite PvP game of all time. I would play it daily if I could, even working full time. I would find time for this game. I would even spend money on skins and ♥♥♥♥, knowing full well that EA is evil and doesn't deserve a penny from me. The game is that freakin' good. In theory. But I gotta stop lying to myself every few months just to be immediately disappointed each time I try to go back. When I mention Apex at this point my friends just laugh and then we return to reality. This game is unplayable. Each season has brought with it some kinda new bugs to exploit or server instability or poor map rotation, etc. But the unfair matchmaking has been the one glaring constant for seemingly the entirety of Apex's existence outside of maybe the beta run, during which I was too bad at the game to notice any critical nuances. But yeah, the community feedback loudly confirms this. Glancing up, I see the recent reviews on Steam have been crap. Shocking. Yet here we are, again, as always. Perhaps EA's market research suggests that they shouldn't fix this problem for some disgusting micro-transaction-related reason. Honestly, at this point, I HOPE the reason is something outwardly malicious like that, if only to confirm that they have a vested interest in NOT fixing anything. Because otherwise there's just truly no excuse. RIP this game.  Update 11.25.23 It's somehow worse than ever. Placed in Silver 2, I'm being put exclusively in Diamond+ lobbies despite my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats this season and no ranked history in the last few seasons. Judging by Reddit/Steam forums, it's a widespread issue. Even in solo queue there is no escape. 'Bout ready to just cut my losses here.","1,042.8",91130149,0,Recommended
2024-07-10 00:00:00,"Edit: In recent developments, EA and Respawn just blamed Linux users for all cheating problems and disabled EAC Linux support for Apex. Another great step in the completely wrong direction. My original review below still stands as well.   Apex currently has:  - audio issues - performance issues - netcode issues - security issues. Someone called destroyer2009 turned on hacks for multiple pro’s DURING a live streamed ALGS regional final. The infected accounts were banned and the pro’s had to use brand new accounts(imagine the amount of time and money wasted because EA and Respawn refuse to address and fix the actual issue). Then one of the banned account showed up IN the lobby of the pro whose account it used to be, on another livestream. So EA and Respawn still haven’t fixed severe security issues. But hey the micro transactions work juuuuussssttt fine. Which brings me to the next point. - at least five different in-game currencies. - cheaters galore. Both on PC and consoles. Again Respawn refuses to even acknowledge the issue. - a disgusting monetisation model focused on providing less and less for free and forcing people to pay for even the most basic cosmetics. - account progress issues. Your money can be transferred to EA just fine. But your might not receive your in-game currency/items. Oh and you can also lose all your saved up currencies in the game. Such great fun that is.   Now you wanna know what Respawn and EA are focusing on in the upcoming season 22? Spoiler alert: it’s not any of the actual issues I listed above.  No, dear reader. Instead they are focusing on making the battles pass, which you can currently acquire using Apex Coins, a paid item. Your “premium” in-game currency was just rendered useless. Previously if you bought the battle pass once and completed it, you had enough AC to buy it again next season. Now they want you to buy the battle pass with ONLY with actual money and there are TWO premium tiers with premium+ having exclusive cosmetics not available otherwise. Oh you think that’s bad? They will split the battle pass into two per season so you have to PAY TWICE IN ONE SEASON.   Apex used to get a new legend each season and multiple new maps and weapons per year. Now they chug out map redesigns, add maybe one weapon per year(AT BEST) and skip new legends every other season to “spend time and resources on QOL improvements”.   Apex has been losing players consistently in the past months. And a large number of players have just left the game after the season 22 BP changes were announced. If Respawn and EA chose to focus on improving the game instead of being greedy scum, the game would be in a much, much better place.   Save your time, money and sanity. In its current state, Apex is not worth it.",429.3,292523,0,Recommended

2021-12-02 00:00:00,"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.",512.0,10039274,0,Recommended

2024-07-30 00:00:00,"773 hours on steam 1260 hours on origin S1 player  This is the worst state the game has been in. Corporate greed has destroyed the game. There have been more updates in the shop rather than the actual content. Respawn and EA are milking the player base for half-baked skins. Most recently, they have repackaged a collector’s event into a “milestone event.” The skins themselves are mediocre, and you are forced to gamble if there are any skins you desire.  Above all, EA and Respawn are down bad for money. Their tactics for monetization are downright disgusting. The entire business model is milking the loyal player base for as much money as they can get. They have not been doing anything to increase the player count or to get new people to play.  They are most likely using the “walk back” method. It is where they will roll out a massive change, and proceed to revert it halfway after negative feedback so people are accepting of a new worse standard. They are only updating their live service ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that the battle pass does not bring in players – it is the game and the quality of the gameplay. The real issue is Respawn and EA having predatory monetary practices instead of fixing the bugs and vast cheater problem. It is evident that several issues and bugs are here to stay, given how long they have been in the game. A five-year-old, multi-billion-dollar AAA game consistently has failures and game-breaking issues.  Respawn is doing the bare minimum in communication (Responding to the situation and fixing it quickly.) The only time they have communicated with the player base is after the negative decline of the game. Respawn has released a statement saying that they need to be better. However, this is a response to the negative feedback, not to the community. The community they got the feedback from was likely their shareholders! This is a statement and not a genuine action! Most of their social media posts are about cosmetics!  This downward spiral will only worsen until Respawn recognizes and understands the importance of improving the player's experience. These are some of the common issues the game has faced: - Rampant cheating issue - Pro players are given aimbot mid-ALGS game - No audio: The game does not need to prioritize these things • My teammate's footsteps • My teammate's healing audio • Any voice line that isn't telling me there's another team • Annoying SFX for killing the kill leader/champion - Evo level up - Input latency - MnK noreg hit registration (feels so muddy) - Inability to patch glitches - Harsh SBMM matchmaking - Rough solo queue experience - Visual clutter (issue has been in the game since release) - Bullet flinch/Aim Punch - Stale meta - Server lag: • Ping jittering (up and down in steps of 1ms in a 10-20ms range, as well as climbing up and down between 20ms and 100ms throughout the game) • Packet loss • Servers are extremely unstable at times. • Servers are still 20 ticks • Rubberbanding",773.2,159411,0,Recommended

The movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.  The legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can. And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.  if you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.",669.2,23047,0,Recommended

Next is time to talk about the garbage anti-cheat system. I can usually meet one to two hackers a match.A single match. Which means that cheaters are now so common to the game now, but guess what ea/respawn do? Yeah,they turn a blind eye to this issue Completely ignoring it. Finally what the ea and respawn really care is the property that they can earn form this game. They always make some new skins which are sold at an absurdly overwhelming price. Also they previously decided to change the price of the battle pass from 950 apex coins to 19.99 USD which is incredibly insane.

2023-12-24 00:00:00,"I played this game for over 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the game is beyond awful:  1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are constant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best setup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an option, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users.  2. No audio issue: its been so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot for the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone speak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jumps or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons.  3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more.  4. Matchmaking: I feel like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-players or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills - none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies. I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill level skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it.  5. Ranked: Current Ranked System is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and nothing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completely draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta.  6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked because those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against.  7. Overall quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want this game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing people through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thought id be working hard on to improve myself in.  Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, but the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it.  I play on a gaming-Laptop from 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this review if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cashgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard.

No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events.

And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.  Gunplay → Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.  → One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes.  → Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.  → Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance.  → A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme.  → Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.  → There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well.  → With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.  → There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.  → Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards.  → The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying . The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.  Apex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play.",302.6,4401233,0,Recommended

2023-04-22 00:00:00,"I want to continue to love this game, the controls, movement & weapons are excellent and overall gameplay is super enjoyable... but the matchmaking will ensure you're never actually having fun. It's a sweatfest nightmare now. You'll be paired against absurdly high level people so far above your rank and skillset you'll question if the matchmaking is genuinely broken.  It also seems most of the OG devs have left Respawn (including the main map designer) as evidenced by (in part) the complete and utter lack of communication between the studio and community. Storm Point + Broken Moon are poorly designed snorefests that throw almost all their POIs on the very outside edge that are immediately consumed by the ring with vast expanses of nothing towards the middle. Patch notes no longer have any explanation as to why what was done and where, something done in most major previous updates.  This all leaves out the game's absurdly greedy prices for skins + events and etc. Don't buy them, seriously. $20+ for a single skin is ludicrous. And as of now (April of 2023) there have been six collection events since the start of the year. SIX.","1,114.6",5422233,0,Recommended

2023-06-01 00:00:00,"I can't say it's a good game, mostly due to the vast majority of its player base trying to get under your skin to make you as angry as they are. I don't blame them. This game is so flawed in many aspects, and no amount of perks will ever fix that. Take it from me. You could spend your time doing much better things, like learning to cook Bucatini with mushrooms & sausage.  Hell, let me teach you how:  You'll need: -1 lb Bucatini pasta -1/2 lb Italian sausage, casings removed -8 oz sliced mushrooms -1/2 onion, chopped -2 cloves garlic, minced -1/2 cup dry white wine -1 cup chicken or vegetable broth -1/2 cup heavy cream -1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese -2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley -2 tbsp olive oil -Salt and pepper, to taste  1. Cook the Bucatini pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.  2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook for 8–10 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until it's browned and fully cooked. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.  3. In the same skillet, sauté sliced mushrooms, chopped onions, and minced garlic for 3–4 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.  3. Pour dry white wine into the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until the liquid has reduced by half.  4. Add chicken or vegetable broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  5. Stir in the cooked sausage, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until the cheese has melted, and the sauce is creamy.  6. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  7. Divide the cooked Bucatini pasta onto serving plates and spoon the mushroom and sausage sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.  You're done! Go prepare some nice pasta and impress your friends.",66.4,30612835,0,Recommended
2022-12-29 00:00:00,"With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn't recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say ""thats just a skill issue"" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex's skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level. I hope this review is helpful. sincerely, a concerned player.",791.7,164512,0,Recommended
2024-07-23 00:00:00,"I've been a fan of Apex Legends since its launch, but my patience has run out. The game's anti-cheat system is a complete joke. Almost every match is plagued with cheaters who ruin the experience for everyone. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to be repeatedly defeated by hackers.  What's worse is the apparent lack of effort from the developers to address this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the game's security, they seem more interested in pushing out overpriced cosmetic items. The amount of money they expect players to spend on skins and other in-game items is ridiculous. It feels like they're more concerned with lining their pockets than providing a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.  Moreover, the constant bugs and glitches make the game nearly unplayable at times. Important updates and fixes are either delayed or half-baked, leading to even more frustration. The developers need to get their priorities straight and focus on the core issues that are driving players away.  Overall, Apex Legends has so much potential, but it’s being squandered by a money-hungry publisher and a pitiful anti-cheat system. Save your time and money and find a game that actually values its player base.","1,603.1",137310,0,Recommended

My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

2021-07-15 00:00:00,"Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.  Pros: - Excellent Movement. - Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good. - Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion. - New legends and weapons added every season. - Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh. - Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass. - Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season's battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted). - Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc. - You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.  Cons: - Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !) - Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! ) - Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18. - In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming. - Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is ""we are working on it"" etc. - Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets. - Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can't even get into a game.  - SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3 and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.  The main reason why I can't recommend this game to new players is because I don't see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don't have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.  At the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.","3,219.4",1697113201,0,Recommended
2021-04-09 00:00:00,"Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don't play these types of games - they're just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I've formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.  Do I think Apex Legends is good? Honestly...yes. I do. I didn't expect it but I've been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that's enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.  There are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let's break them down point by point.  - The guns in Apex are to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I'd choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say ""hey I died but I had fun"". Not everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can't just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying. On top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don't think they work very well and they aren't anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there's memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it's because they just really don't fit in with the way this game wants you to play it. To clarify - I'm not saying they're useless, I'm just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.  - This game's abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren't integrated into gameplay properly. It's the one thing that I dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you're getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once. But perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they're conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not. Overall though, I appreciate that this game doesn't make it so you to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you use if you need it.  - I love this game's movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it's no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter. The only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it's super satisfying but does it feel awkward initially.  This is a free-to-play game, it's natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they've created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how's the monetization in this game? Honestly I'm incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.  - The DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I'm hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it's just a shame altogether - I'd personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.  - I think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I'm not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I've gathered they don't do limited-time lootbox drops so they're avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they're there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.  - This is one thing I actively dislike about this game's monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like ""Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin"", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you ""buy premium to get this skin!"", at which point I just wanna tell the game to ♥♥♥♥ off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.  How are the other aspects of the game?  - For being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching. Some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It's not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.  - The sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying. The music isn't anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don't really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about. The voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.  - I think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn't seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it's just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.  There are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it's satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.",98.3,2001116,0,Recommended

2023-08-19 00:00:00,"It's absolutely impossible to enjoy Apex Legends!  The Good Honestly, the core gameplay of Apex Legends has to be one of the best games out right now. The weapons, the characters, the movement mechanics, everything is deep and enjoyable. If it's all you look at, and when they truly feel balanced, it really is a great game at it's core, but it's potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team.  Horrific match making, there is no such thing as casual play. I can't understand it, what am I even playing? I'm a dad, I play a couple hours a week of video games, I just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun, NOT ALLOWED! You will play against the sweatiest try-hards imaginable EVERY GAME, no breaks.  It's brutal, but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way, more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way. If you play regular lobbies, you play against the top 1% multi-thousand kills players, you play ranked, you still play against those same guys! What's the point of either one, I just want to play against players around my skill level, I don't want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple-take from miles away.  I don't want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no-mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs. I don't want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and I just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50/50 shot at who gets a down first. The game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win, or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight.  There's so much ugly about this game, the toxic player base, the hacking, the over-powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins, the overpriced store items, the audio, the list is endless.  Some of my favorite streamers, and yours', play this game and even for them it's a brutal grind but sometimes it's impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun. The reality is very far from that, those guys play 8-10 hours every day for years to get that good. Playing this game for the first time, or even casually is absolutely impossible. A great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions.",322.5,6805490,0,Recommended

Respawn has made a statement addressing multiple key issues and saying that they are the priorities for the dev team such as: cheaters, quality of life changes, etc. I will NOT change this review to positive until they follow through and deliver what they promise, there has been too many times where we were told things are being done only for no word on the matter for months/years.","2,817.3",11319,0,Recommended

2022-07-20 00:00:00,"The Best Battle Royale on the Market with some Faults  Pros: + Smoothest Movement + Satisfying gunplay + Every animation & sound effect is so distinct, you can tell where and what is coming towards you. + Stressful but rewarding final circles in Ranked + Crossplay with friends on consoles (Nintendo Switch players are free kills) + Easy to complete battle pass within a month of playtime. + Beautiful maps such as Olympus & Stormpoint to the sweaty competitive maps, World's Edge & King's Canyon.  Neutral: - Shares the same universe as Titanfall but the lore is okayish. - I honestly think Apex has the worst cosmetic team next to Halo Infinite. Some of them are really just nice but exclusive to the battle pass or collection events. If you do find a really good skin that isn't a recolor of the default model, be ready to shell out 18/35/50 dollars up to 160+. It's honestly a cycle with this game, you get 3 seasons of good skins and 3 seasons of mediocre or trash skins. - If you don't like the battle royale mode, there is a lite economy round based 3v3 mode to mess around in called Arenas. - Limited time game modes like Control (Domination if you ever played COD) should be in the base game. - Like every modern game today, the matchmaking system pits you against or with pro players, new players, or the average 2 hour free time guy. - Since the game is free to play, there's lootboxes, completely random. Some get Heirlooms Shards (0.2% chance of dropping) early on, while it took me 800 hours. Heirloom Shards are for melee weapons or prestige Legends skins that do not affect gameplay. There is a bunch of crap in the lootboxes to further your chances of not getting what you want. - Characters aside from the default roster need to be bought with in game currency or real money. They also cannot be tested in the firing range.   - Somehow there's a game breaking bug every season. - Squads/Quads (teams of 4) doesn't exist, leaving that one friend all alone while the rest play Trios. Nor is there a true solos mode. - Servers are really bad causing desyc/bullets aren't registering, crashing, or disconnects. - Enemy footsteps sometimes doesn't work. - Joke of an esport; the recent ALGS 2022 had players dc, visas denied, teams teleporting across the map and dying to their deaths, or players gettings covid - forcing teams to play as a duo instead as a trio. The tournament organizers didn't want to restart despite all these problems. Also they didn't even play on LAN?? The event was connected to the nearest server. Even the custom matches for pros to scrim in, didn't work for a while. - The balancing or design team whatever you want to call them is very questionable. You have 2 Legends, Seer & Valkyrie dominating tournaments without a single nerf in sight meanwhile, Lifeline's old shield passive was reworked into a new Legend, we have two of the same character now. Which leads onto my next point, a few characters share the same ability just slightly different. Sooner or later the game will become a massive unbalancing mess than it already is. Then finally, some Legends that need a buff stay untouched for a very long time. - Easy anti-cheat would sometimes blue screen my computer or crash my game back to the desktop once in a blue moon. - The lack of a spectating system without going into match or a dedicated match history.    - ImperialHal, Reps, Albralelie, HisWattson, Apryze, Sweetdreams, Hardecki, Nafen, Taisheen, Mande, sYnceD, Monsoon, Rogue   - Aceu, Stormen, Taxi2g, Faide, Crylix   - ChaoticMuch, Verhulst, Daltoosh, Staynaughty, Knoqd, Pandxrz, Snip3down, Thekine   - Rag Tagg, Lej, Emerald Gemerald & the butt load of vtubers on Apex   - TheGamingMerchant & Mokeysniper   - Cheetah, Tooncraft, Hoxdolum, & dopatwo","3,434.8",2841640,0,Recommended

2021-04-18 00:00:00,"IS IT WORTH PLAYING ?   Honestly, Yes! I played this game when it first released. That would be approximately 2 years back. And this game is flat out the best Battle Royale, FPS, and overall game out there. Never once was I bored... frustrated? -yes... irritated? -100% ... bored? -NEVER! The fact that you have abilities and passive its feels like if... Overwatch and Counter Strike had a baby, and Valorant and PUBG had a baby and in some way the product of the two banged and gave birth to a baby.. then that would be Apex Legends.  Lots of gun inspiration and character inspiration comes from the Titanfall games, mostly because the game kind of plays itself in the Titanfall Universe, which I haven't really played so I can't give much information on how similar they are or anything like that.  Like most recent games, Apex legends also has its own called .  And not to forget , yes, this game has it too, and I am not going to sit here and rant on how good or bad they are. I would rather like to talk about how they are different from others. Its system and all is just like any other lootbox system, something that might differ from other lootbox systems is, you will never get a repeated item, but if you own an item and you end up reopening the same item in the future , then in place of getting a repeat you are rewarded with crafting materials (How much of it depends on the Tier of the repeated item), which if collected, lets you unlock default skins or sometimes, buy a weapon skin/ Legend skin from events.( Which in general costs in-game currency )      1. Shooting 2. Movement 3. Healing 4. Abilities [for all legends] :     The game for the most party rewards an aggressive playstyle, and has wonderful movement mechanics. Reaching a high movement skill cap in conjunction with a good aggressive playstyle has certain benefits and will probably win you many fights, but in the end it is a Battle Royale and you are at risk of getting 3rd partied. A good balance between knowing what fight to take and when to be aggressive and to hold position and angles will overall make you a better player and give your better results. [ Though honestly playing 100% aggressive is VERY fun ]     In terms of graphics yes it is good visually, and it runs on the Source engine which allowed for couple of mechanics to come in like B-hopping, which was soon sort of patched out and others like getting a short speed boost while strafing in air, and couple more.  Not all Legends are of equal Height and Width, meaning each and every Legend has a different hitbox. Some are small and some are large. As of 2021, smaller Legends take extra damage [5% extra incoming damage - Harder to hit ] and similarly larger Legends take less[15% reduced incoming damage - Easier to hit].  The Audio is not entirely the best, sometimes its just weird, this is honestly one of the places I feel the game developers need to seriously focus their attention at.                                  And I would Play 500 times And I would game 500 more Just to be the man who rocks a thousand wins and probably a couple more.  In all seriousness, give the game a try... don't lose hope and you'll surely love it more and more.","1,018.3",10368,0,Recommended

2020-11-06 00:00:00,"I played nearly 600 hours of this game on Origin before the Steam release, which is practically unheard of for me in any game. I'm also not a huge multiplayer PvP game fan, so to get so invested in this game says a lot to me.  With that last thought in mind, I'm also far from a great player. I'll have my moments and I'd say I'm pretty mediocre at this point, but I'll still get slapped down pretty hard when my MMR seems to start getting too high. Even still, I've steadily brought my K/D ratio up from a miserable .23 at launch to a current .60 with starting out season 7.  It's not perfect, and there have been issues plaguing nearly every season. Most recently this season's biggest issue is the battle pass, which was tweaked to make the grind insufferable and hard for any normal person (like me) to dream of completing. Previously there were widespread issues with hits not registering. And as with many PvP multiplayer games, there's a certain toxic element in the playerbase that can be hard to avoid; I've spent probably 95% of my time playing this game with a pre-made squad to avoid playing with randoms. Never mind the 20 tick servers they've been using since launch which may be unacceptable to those with more experience in PvP games like this.  Even with the issues this game does have, it's still a blast to play. Each character is unique and the movement is quick, snappy and just feels so good. Even the sound effects of breaking shields and knocking down opponents are incredibly satisfying. I may not be joining in on this season's battle pass without a major overhaul to minimize the excessive grind, but I'm definitely going to be putting another stack of triple-digit hours into this game going forward.  Edit 1 - A bit under 20 hours for me to unlock all of the Steam achievements, which on Origin took me some 150+ hours to accomplish. Some of these unlocked early with my carried-over Origin data, but I have still pulled off a win with 8 different legends across the 4 different hero types to feel like I ""legitimately"" earned it on Steam as well. I've also so far kept my season K/D ratio slightly over 1.0 after 100+ games, so I'm super excited to see just how much I've improved. Cannot recommend this game enough for a battle royale PvP game to anyone who has friends to play it with.  Edit 2 - Now approaching 250 hours in Steam (so roughly 850 hours total including Origin) and still having a mostly great time. The newest season was absolutely the most stable so far as well, even if the new map is a bit of a mixed bag.",459.2,6833,0,Recommended

2024-07-08 00:00:00,"The game was great. I've been playing since launch day and I absolutely love this game.  That's been said I'm just tired of EA, it sucks, pretty bad. The anti cheat doesn't work, the game is full of cheaters, the audio doesn't work like a lot of the time, configs files are a thing, they don't listen to their community, doesn't reward older players, INSANE macrotransactions for some content... The list just goes on and on... Honestly mostly of that didn't matter to me, I would just jump in with some friends, have fun as I level up my battle pass and log out once the grind was over. Buying the battle pass for free with the money from olders ones is literally the only thing that makes you feel rewarded as an older player and they removed that from us. I'm just tired of this game, please give me Titanfall 3, I'm tired of this company.  With love: A week one OG Apex player.","1,391.0",131210,0,Recommended

2021-01-05 00:00:00,"I have 0 hours on Steam because I've played over 900 hours on Origin, and let me just tell you that I personally think this is the greatest Battle Royale game ever created. It blends the perfect mix of gunplay, communication, and mobility to create an almost perfect game. There are some kinks.  For new players, which I assume a lot of the people reading this review are going to be/are currently, the issue with ""smurf accounts"" is rampant and it can be a very difficult experience getting used to the game and its combat when level 450 Wraith mains create a new account and then dunk on the newbies with a Wingman. If you stick with the game and reach level 10 or 20, this becomes less of a problem as many smurf accounts are used a few times to troll or have fun without reaching higher levels.  If you even consider playing ranked, expect a massive amount of cheating. Respawn has not fixed the issue of hacked clients and very often you see players who have hundreds of kills still playing fine in ranked lobbies. It is currently an extremely toxic and impossible environment to play, not mentioning the many glitches and bugs that plague it, and I really hope Respawn takes the time to fix those issues in the next ranked season.  As is customary with Electronic Arts, they do enjoy getting consumers to pay as much as possible and recently were exposed for putting certain cosmetics with unmatching sets in the store, even though the teasers for the new items showed said items together in a uniform set. This is only a big deal if you ever really consider putting money into the game. The only benefit to using the in-game store is cosmetics, and by playing regularly you can earn a lot of rare and legendary items yourself.  These are either recent or temporary problems, however, and the benefits and pros of this game FAR outweigh the cons. If you have been looking for a Battle Royale that is unique in its own sense and will take you away from the endless spam of Fortnite, PUBG, Warzone, and other popular BRs, this game is absolutely for you. Please give Apex a try, I am almost certain you will not regret it.",373.0,14765,0,Recommended
