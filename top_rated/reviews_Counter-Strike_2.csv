2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.

Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.4",8542440,0,Recommended

Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,378.7",132130108,0,Recommended

2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",111127268,0,Recommended

2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","6,669.4",8542440,0,Recommended
