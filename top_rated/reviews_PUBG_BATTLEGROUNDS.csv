2020-06-25 00:00:00,"After almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

2020-01-17 00:00:00,"After 2 years and 2,200 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.  This game is utterly brilliant from its idea - Erangel is like the perfect BR map, weapon control is brilliant, but the way how PUBG is developing the game is just blatant and careless.

Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel. Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.  When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!  It really feels like the Devs completely lost the roadmap and made the rest up as they went along, stealing other games recipes and jumbling it up into one mess.

2023-08-27 00:00:00,"I have over 6 thousand hours in this game, so I'd have some ground to stand on when it comes to posting an honest review of this game:  It's a fun game, when you are playing with the right people and don't really care too much about actual game-play. But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.

The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked.

Yes it plays quite well and visually looks better than ever - but it's really lost that PUBG magic and feel. Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.  When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!  It really feels like the Devs completely lost the roadmap and made the rest up as they went along, stealing other games recipes and jumbling it up into one mess.

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money.

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.  This game is utterly brilliant from its idea - Erangel is like the perfect BR map, weapon control is brilliant, but the way how PUBG is developing the game is just blatant and careless.

Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.  When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

2020-01-17 00:00:00,"After 2 years and 2,200 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions.

When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes.

The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself.

I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy.

Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked.

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions. Everything just feels cluttered and complicated as soon as you log on with a very messy UI.  When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this. I simply cannot recommend this game to anybody, but my voice doesn't matter in the grand scheme here.","1,076.5",7693340,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.  ---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.

2020-01-17 00:00:00,"After 2 years and 2,200 hours of gameplay, I was Permanently Banned from PUBG without any reasoning provided. I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for?

You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions.

When you get into a lobby you're now greeted by people running around as multi coloured anime looking characters/skins, and I'm pretty sure Barney the dinosaur ran past me at one point... It's like it's suddenly lost it's own identity and copied Fortnite?!

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

If i want a fast paced BR i play CoD - Too many different game modes - why would you have ranked and normal? just stick to one game mode, and the player base wont get split - All new updates and features only aim towards one goal - earning more money and attract new players to earn more money, while loosing your loyal players - The reporting of other players is completly out of hands - PUBG is not investigating if anyone is actually cheating or griefing, but banning players because of the numbers of reports the player gets - for me this results in almost consistent bans every two weeks because of my winrate, which is around 25% of all the games i play - makes a lot of fun, if you look forward to play some games and then you are banned - again and again  Thank you a lot PUBG; for me banning me all the time and for ruining my game experience.

Empty feeling lobbies with bots filling numbers, a new menu / system every time I log on it feels like, and so many micro transactions.

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning. But, there are so many issues that need to be resolved that Krafton are just not addressing which is why I can't whole heatedly recommend this game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME.

I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.  Honestly I wouldn't say this game is a hard no, there are times it's a lot of fun, which is why I keep returning.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM. If you view my account on PUBG Report (CATDADDY_TeDo) you will see my stats (they are not very impressive, as I am not a good player). I've always enjoyed playing the game regardless of its many shortcomings (desync issues, glitches and bugs from updates, aimbotters, etc.). But to devote so much time toward a game and then be outright Permanently Banned for absolutely no reason is absurd.  I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee.

One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended

The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it.

I have purchased every Event Pass, and even purchased in-game cosmetics, making the account worth a great deal to me in many ways.  This was not a VAC ban, and I have never cheated in any game in the 16 years I have owned STEAM.

I took the time to submit a dispute ticket to PUBG Support, but in return I simply received an automated message stating the rules of the game, one of which was *apparently* violated. It was not a personal response, as the reviewer clearly did not investigate the Ban, he/she just copied and pasted an automated response.  My advice: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. Perhaps if you play infrequently and do not get reported by users enough (salty players who report all others who eliminate them) you will not get banned. But there is no guarantee. You can get sucked in and spend money on each Event Pass just to eventually be banned without reason. Such a shame.","2,806.8",12151513,0,Recommended

One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team.  People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story.  The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters.  I have no faith in what the developers say or promise anymore. Utterly disappointed.","6,182.9",709774,0,Recommended

2019-03-06 00:00:00,"Update: 01/26/2022  This game was released for free. I want my money back, to be honest. Every issue in my review below has gotten about ten times worse. The hacker problem is so bad you can't get a game without them now, there's still no actual content for people who got suckered into buying this game. This has to be one of the worst dev teams on the industry.  Updated: 06/03/20  The Dev's have made solid strides in combatting the hackers and its now very possible to get a match without any foul play. Many of the bugs have also been fixed, graphics have been improved, and animation and quality of life is much better. Customization options have improved and progression is now present. PUBG also provides one of the most gritty, brutal, and earthy experiences out of any of the battle royals present, and can now actually deliver on its promised gameplay. And I'd love, LOVE to say I could recommend the game now. But honestly? I can't. Why? The absolutely predatory monetization! We're talking a Battle Pass that practically begs you to spend money. I can let it slide for Apex, and Warzone. Why? Those games are free. This paid battle pass system is absolutely unacceptable in a pay up front game. I'd love to access those new cosmetic items but if you think I'm paying for a game twice to do so you are out of your god forsaken mind. This season pass crap is the new loot boxes. Vote with your wallet people, say no to this crap.  Original Review Written 03/20/2019  I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through.  I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.",85.4,880463,0,Recommended

But, if you do care about the game-play, you will find the game to feel outdated with clunky movement and still have several bugs here and there that are several years old and have not been patched out.  Cheaters are a constant problem in the game, you will likely be running into a blatant cheater every 1 in 3 games. I know there are people out there that will just think ""This guy is just getting wrecked by people who are better than him, he doesn't know what he's talking about"". But, the reason I have so many hours in this game is because I used to be a competitive player for several years, so I'd like to think I know how to spot the cheaters from people who are just good at the game.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,"This game should be filed under the dictionary definition of missed potential.  Lets wind back time and look at where this all began, pubg is released in 2017 and dominates the market with new battle royal game, literally gets everyone under the bright gaming lights of their 144hz monitors to play it. Gun play is tight but issues with performance and cheating are significant.  4 years later, its suffering from the same issues along with new trouble its invented for itself by not listening to the community. Cheaters, not refining core gameplay, adding features noone wants or asks for, the most expensive scam defining skins in any game these are the defining characteristics of this game, and really its a shame because under all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is some of the best gun play of any fps on the market.  Honestly most of these issues I can forgive, as someone who has over 2k hours in it, there is great potential here. The real defining problem, and it is the most significant problem, is ""Blue Balls"" aka the brain dead developers. They have never listened to their community, ever since after like a month of the game being out the community recognised that the red zones should be removed.  Simply trimming the bad maps, adding new mechanics to ensure safer rotations, a focus on meds and ammo instead of wasted spawns, most of these fixes that are suggested by the pilars of the community as simply done with a quick patch, yet the devs just double down on new maps, $500 skins, and patches that always break the game.  TL;DR: Save yourself the 30 bucks and ring up that old pot smoking friend from highschool who still lives in his mums basement, because that moment where you hear their voice crack as they recognise they haven't changed in 10 years is the same thing you'll feel in 4 years if you are still playing this pile of ♥♥♥♥.","2,850.9",6888838,0,Recommended

The devs refused to optimize it and even back when I did play, the test server ran at least 5 times better than the live servers. So I know that it was possible to optimize it better, but I waited and waited and it never happened. Finally, after playing it since the beta, I got randomly banned for 'cheating' in late 2021. I have seen this happen to way too many players as well, specifically the ones who are actually good at the game: like TGLTN, who seem to get banned every other month for cheating when they are clearly not. On top of that, they have no way to be unbanned if proof is shown that you did not cheat. I lost out on 30-50 dollars, between my inventory and actually paying for the game, because of this.

2019-10-02 00:00:00,"Boy oh boy, here we go. I don't feel as ""qualified"" to write this review as some, because of my comparatively low amount of hours played. But, I have been playing since early 2017 when the game was first becoming popular.  PUBG is an extremely polarizing game. It seems that you either hate it or you don't. There are many reasons for this. This review is mainly focused on giving you a snapshot of one player's experience (myself, obviously), and my ultimate verdict on whether or not this game is worth your 30 USD.  The concept of the game is great. If you don't like battle royales, don't play it. If you like battle royales, you might like it. Simple as that.  PUBG has a focus on realistic, skill-based weapon handling and gameplay. Obviously, it's not a simulator in the sense of realism, but the weapon physics - bullet drop, bullet velocity, shotgun spread, etc. - is quite reasonable. It's a game that is difficult to learn, let alone master, unless you've played a lot of games with similar gameplay, like DayZ or Arma 3.  I'm not going to go into the variety of weapons, maps, and tactics in this review. The main purpose is to address the primary issues people have with the game. From my experience (which includes reading many other reviews), these issues are: hackers, lag/desync, poor optimization, and bad game support. Let's break them down one by one.  PUBG has always had a major hacker problem. If you've been following the game for a while like I have, you know that PUBG Corp (the company that now owns the game) has been fighting hackers since release. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, have been banned during the game's lifetime. There was a time when you would get killed by someone using aimbot at least half of the time. I remember a game where I looked at the kill feed and suddenly saw there were only 15 people left - 2 minutes into the game. Then I got hit with a shotgun. Watching the deathcam, I saw a naked man holding a shotgun, spinning rapidly in all directions, shooting wildly, halfway across the map. Killing everyone. Hacking is a problem. But - but! It is not as big of a problem as it used to be. You will read reviews that say that ""oh I die to hackers literally 90% of the time"" and stuff like that. I don't want to slander anyone, but I have a really hard time believing those reviews. In the last three months, I have played about a 900 games (the game tracks your stats closely). I have been killed by an obvious hacker twice. TWICE. I reported them both times, and, both times, I got a message from the game a few days later telling me that the player I had reported had been banned. The inherent problem is that many people, I think, don't understand the difference between being really good and hacking. It's easy to cry AIMBOT! at someone who killed you with a full-auto burst from an assault rifle at 100 meters, but maybe that person is a god-tier player with 3000+ hours under their belt? My experience: hacking is no longer the huge, gamebreaking issue it once was, and should not be something that stops you from buying and playing the game.  Next is lag/desync. This, I have also had a history of problems with. I have lost games because my game desynced. Is this the fault of the developers, or my own crappy internet connection? I don't know. What I do know is that, in the last three months, I have experienced major desync maybe once. Maybe. And I don't get lag anymore. I think that your own internet connection has a much bigger chance of ruining the game with lag and desync, and I don't think that the game itself is broken in this way.  Now for poor optimization. This one is big for me. This game is terribly optimized, especially for FPS. My GTX 1080 can't even give me 70 FPS at moderate settings. I haven't been able to find a fix. Many others have this problem or others. I don't see any justification for how a game this popular that has been out for this long can still be so poorly optimized. This one is tough, but I deal with it because I like the game.  And, finally, poor development support. I won't go into this one much, because everyone has different opinions on what the developer should update or change next. I will say that PUBG Corp cares about money more than its players, and they usually focus or releasing new (obscenely expensive for what they are) skins over new content.  In conclusion, while PUBG is a flawed game that will always be divisive, I recommend it. The issues I have mentioned are usually overblown by people who hate the game, in my experience. Give it a try, and who knows, you might get hooked. But if you stop playing after 3 hours, I don't think it will be because of any of the big issues. It will be because it just isn't the right game for you.  Thank you for reading this review; I hope it helps you.",544.4,438211,0,Recommended
