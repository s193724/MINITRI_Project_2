Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.  Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as Очи чёрные (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).

730,2017-03-02 00:00:00,"""Teamwork makes the dream work"" — or makes you question humanity  Review: After 1500+ hours of gameplay, I’ve unlocked a deep understanding of teamwork—or so I thought, until my teammate flashbanged the entire team into oblivion, planted the bomb on the wrong site, and then called us noobs. This game isn’t just a tactical shooter; it’s a masterclass in trust issues, skill issues, and every other kind of nonsense issue you didn’t know you had.  Here are a few invaluable lessons I’ve picked up along the way: The difference between a teammate and an enemy? Just the color of their uniform—and yes, I’ll still shoot both.  Communication is key. Unfortunately, when your team speaks six different languages, “Rush B” turns into a sitcom horror show.  90% of the game is tactical planning. The other 10% is peeking a corner and getting headshot faster than you can say “AWP.”  There’s no greater thrill than defusing the bomb with 0.01 seconds left on the clock—except realizing your teammate had a defuse kit the entire time and was watching you struggle.    This isn’t just a game; it’s a journey of through pain and chaos. Every round feels like a masterclass in tactical genius—until someone decides to buy and play The maps are intricate mazes designed to teach you how many angles you didn’t check before dying.  feels like conquering Mount Everest. feels like slipping on a banana peel while holding a Either way, you’ll scream, and    The visuals are and but the are the I now own a digital knife worth more than my rent, and I couldn’t be prouder.

One game, you’re part of a The next, your teammate is crouch-walking into a wall while blasting in voice chat.           This game will test your patience, your reflexes, and your will to live. It’s a rollercoaster of epic clutches, humiliating losses, and moments so absurd you’ll laugh until you cry. Somehow, despite the chaos, you’ll keep coming back for  If you enjoy balancing frustration, adrenaline, and moments of pure comedy, this game is your new best friend—and worst enemy. Just remember: it’s not a game—it’s a lifestyle, a therapy session, and a financial investment all in one.  – “Rush B, cyka blyat!”","1,770.6",Recommended,"256 people found this review helpful

730,2024-03-24 00:00:00,"Very long time player here and so far all I can say is Valve is majorly dropping the ball. If any other AAA or large company had a game with this many flaws and major problems they would be getting lambasted on every gaming outlet and forum across the internet. Valves DM servers are almost entirely controlled by botted accounts meant to farm cases/farm hours to be sold. The server browser forces you to tab out and use a browser that looks about 12 years out of date. Oh did I mention the browser is dominated by faked player servers almost all of which are based in Russia and show up no matter what your search parameters are set to? Comp splits your rank to every single map and moves up at a snails pace. Most maps that I have nearly 100% winrate on with 30+ games played on that map and I'm barely above halfway in the rank tier. The new ranked mode (Premier) is infested and owned by cheaters entirely at this point. Starting at 15,000 rating you start encountering brand new accounts who don't even try and hide cheats. 25,000+ is 5v5 Hack v Hack. These cheater matches dont even involve kills that aren't wallbangs. Valves own servers are owned entirely by cheaters at this point. Anyone legit looking to play even at a casual level and up to any tier of competitive is forced to play Faceit a third party service with an actual functioning anti-cheat.  Not only is CS2 a failure so far but they didn't even have the decency to keep up support for valve CSGO servers. Shameful. Game needs a massive turn around if I'm ever gonna take it seriously. Just another massive failure and disappointment in an already disappointing field of entertainment.  What an embarassment.  REVIEW UPDATE The last vac wave seems to have cleaned up the rankings a bit and it seems to be sticking around at least for now. I've managed to achieve 27k rating in NA. That being said there is still an infrequent amount of pretty obvious closet cheaters and the occasional rage cheater. Rank #1 world player is still cheating (he has been since the beta) for example.  Game still has ongoing issues that haven't been addressed or at least still not fully fixed as we approach the year anniversary. Headboosting is still buggy. Rubberbanding when bumping teammates still presents itself. The mini ""teleport jumps"" as you tag/get tagged by enemies is still very jarring. Smoke/molly extinguishing can still be a crapshoot at times. Moving up and down ramps still moves your crosshair vertically in a very jarring and unecessary way. Plenty of various animation bugs with player models especially in relation to ramp movements. These are just some of the things I can mention off of the top of my head. There is still a kill feedback delay that wasn't present in CSGO that makes the game feel slower or just clunky and unpolished.  Besides the gameplay problems we still dont have retakes, danger zone, flying scoutsman, etc etc. The server browser is still a piece of crap that takes you out of the game and it is STILL infested with faked servers. WTF valve how can you not fix this.  Oh yeah and the greatest tragedy of all. Surf is still broken and dead in the water for CS2  But don't worry at the end of the day the in game microtransaction and gambling features will always be working no matter what.","10,396.7",Not Recommended,"1,327 people found this review helpful

730,2023-10-01 00:00:00,"I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.  I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.  YouTube™ Video: How I Play Explained (Sorry If I'm hard to understand, I tried my best)    and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.","4,858.8",Not Recommended,"1,114 people found this review helpful

730,2017-06-02 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike continues to shine as a standout in the world of competitive shooters, delivering an experience that's both deeply tactical and endlessly rewarding. Whether you're a newcomer learning the ropes or a battle-hardened veteran, the game strikes an impressive balance between precision, skill, and teamwork. Its gun mechanics are tight and responsive, and the maps are expertly crafted to encourage strategic play and dynamic encounters.  Every match in Counter-Strike feels like a mental and mechanical test, filled with tension and adrenaline. It's this competitive edge that keeps players coming back, hungry for improvement and those unforgettable clutch moments. The sense of accomplishment after a well-executed round or a comeback win is hard to match.  That said, the game isn't without its challenges. Like many popular online titles, Counter-Strike has long struggled with cheating issues. Running into hackers can be disheartening, especially in a game where fairness and skill are paramount. It breaks immersion and can sometimes discourage even the most dedicated players.  Thankfully, the developers have shown a commitment to addressing this issue. Systems like VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and regular updates demonstrate ongoing efforts to maintain a level playing field. While it's not a perfect solution and cheaters still slip through the cracks, there's noticeable progress, and it gives hope for a cleaner future.  Despite the setbacks, Counter-Strike remains one of the most gripping and enjoyable shooters ever made. The emotional highs, the intensity of close matches, and the bonds formed through teamwork make it a game that's well worth your time — and one that continues to earn its legendary status.","7,083.5",Recommended,"854 people found this review helpful

People seemed to be happy and excited to play with me. I called them friends and they helped me simply by existing and being happy with me. I grew confident, learnt I was actually a bit fun to talk with. This game made me discover myself and I forever will be thankful for that. The thing that makes this game what it is are the people, you'll meet a LOT of them it's upto you to choose who to keep playing with and who to forget and forgive. The people i met through this game are some of my lifelong friends and I am lucky to have those friends.

RIP 2012 CSGO.  EDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge ""fan"" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a ""Noob"" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.  This review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.

730,2024-09-26 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",142.6,Not Recommended,"778 people found this review helpful

Practice all necessary skills for the Game - AIM -> Deathmatch; Aim-Maps; Practice-Maps (Recoilmaster etc.) - Movement -> Climb-servers; Surfing, Prefire-Maps (Shortcuts from Yesber too) - Gamesense -> Matchmaking; Retake-Servers - Mapknowledge -> Callouts; Demos from your favourite Pro-Player, - Nades -> pls learn them - Roles -> Entry; Support; Lurk; AWPer   - Train your Habit (first callout then flame) - play daily to to improve your aim - make pauses every 2-3 games to reset (go outside from the room with your Pc) - stop at the point you get mad (after a loss may)   If you follow all these Steps you will be able to climb the ladder and improve fast.

It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.  I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.  After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).  Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.  However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.  I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.

730,2023-12-24 00:00:00,"Game has been completely ruined and it has nothing to do with the bugs etc, tbh it looks and plays great it is a decent successor to cs-go once you iron out the kinks.. However, the cheaters... premier matchmaking... faceit...  You decided to break all of it, the entire game. Vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn, through walls, whilst bhopping... cheaters can do things they couldn't do in CSGO..... Fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get. Oh look nope, you hardcode subtick.. even though 128 was proven to be working better. Oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either...  Then there is the false bans (I was one of them, the one you caused with your own update. It was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation, not a word to the community just silence...  Ok well lets set that all aside and move on... oh we can't because then there is the exploits, I have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game...  You are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters, without any active client sided anticheat, serverside plugins, fog of war. You don't punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves, you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards. There are more cheaters than pros now...  and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field, we would all get a fair chance to compete. Counter Strike is for everyone... Counter Strike is dying and you guys shot it.  I love counter strike, it was the first game I played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid, I lost entire summers to this. You guys as a Dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game. You throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming ''major''.  You might need to climb off your high horses, play your own game with us, talk to the community a little. Actually respond to feedback. Counter Strike has one of the most dedicated communities and I am sure if you paid even a fraction of it back to us that investment would pay off ten fold for you guys.","3,287.6",Not Recommended,"1,548 people found this review helpful

You can play it like a no-life gremlin, but you can also boot it up and just frick around with the lads and dads without worrying too much about strategic play. It's also a very fun eSport to watch if you're into that sort of thing. My CS:GO phase is done but I will always have fond memories of rushing B sneeki beeki like.

730,2018-10-15 00:00:00,"The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak. There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form.","2,366.0",Recommended,"693 people found this review helpful

730,2019-06-06 00:00:00,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.  I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product  Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).  Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.  It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).  Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).  Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.  If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.  In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.","1,130.5",Recommended,"207 people found this review helpful

730,2021-11-27 00:00:00,"Okay, the game is the number one first person shooter in the world. There are a lot of cheating players. A friend of mine has been cheating for 8 years and despite us reporting him, he hasn't been banned. He continues to play with his inventory of $28,000. Not only him, he and his friends play together. They also play on the FACEIT platform at level 9.  A huge community uses cheats and doesn't get banned. Their Steam profiles are +15 years old, I'm not even talking about CS badges, they have almost every badge that can be obtained since 2014. Let's talk about the trust factor, these players are 100% green factor (never tell me that the trust factor is unmeasurable, we've already gotten past that.) I want you to not believe that a player is not cheating by looking at their profile and gameplay.  Valve's anti-cheat software is really messed up. It has created an industry that will never end, cheat marketing. There are DMA cheats, core cheats and more. I know you're probably reading these articles with a laugh, if you don't believe me, just do some research, meet people, meet people you know, you'll dig deeper after a while.  Honestly, I can assure you that in a competitive game mode where you are playing alone, at least 2 out of 10 players are using external software and at least 1 is using external scripts (recoil). And yes, I am telling you these statistics without any data. I don't believe it. I just live it every day and understand it. Even if you have been watching Overwatch for years, you have to live in the moment to know if a cheater is cheating or not, watching a match history does not give you a clear picture of what is happening. No matter what you say, to catch a really good cheater, you have to be a better cheater than him.  Ignorance is bliss.  > ""Why should I trust you?"" - You don't have to trust what I say, I don't care who you are or what you say. If a person doesn't share what's inside them with others, their soul darkens. Because I like to tell everything honestly. I'm tired of this, you use cheats because of cheaters and it turns into a never ending vicious circle.  > ""What happens now?"" - The worst thing will happen. More cheaters, more players who can't stand losing to cheaters. And maybe you're like ""my friend who can enjoy the game he plays even if he loses to cheaters, I wish everyone was as happy as you.""

But hey, at least you’ll get to experience the sweet, sweet thrill of a game where everything looks fine until you die in 0.1 seconds to someone who’s clearly not from this dimension.

730,2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Don't get me wrong, I approve CS2, but removing CSGO entirely just makes me mad.  Update 26 Feb 2025: Still a downvote. CS2's Season 1 was ok, but Season 2's premier matchmaking is completely broken.  First there's been a lot of troubles for players to queue up with their friends. And Valve's logic: Friends can't play together because their ranks are too far apart, yet when you solo Q you are teamed up with 2 4K's and 1 12K.  Then ranks don't mean much anymore (they really need to be re-calibrated manually, probably). When you go solo Q, you are teamed up with 1 unranked, a 5k player, a 9k and a 11k, I mean, what the f***? And the enemy team has 3 11k's, and 2 9k's.  Then on your team, the ""high ranked"" players may have good aim but have no game sense. Others ""good players"" don't know that they can sell his gun when others drop. Then the lower ranked ones may have a godlike reaction time but are clueless about the map. The unranked (usually come with a mate of them) usually take the enemy's AWP but keep it for themselves instead of giving it to the team leader who's been playing excellently with that gun. Others don't even know that they have to plant the bomb xD.  You get the picture.","5,429.4",Not Recommended,"4,932 people found this review helpful

730,2018-10-01 00:00:00,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol  Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.  To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:  * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on  * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player  * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google  * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100  * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it  * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve  * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves  * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me  * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable  Good luck!","1,722.7",Recommended,"369 people found this review helpful

730,2023-09-28 00:00:00,"What was the point of releasing this? A large amount of features and modes that were in CS:GO are just gone. War Games and most of its associated maps are removed. All of the local T's/CT's are missing, even the ones they remade for Dust2 and Nuke a while back. Danger Zone, the mode they added before they went Free-to-Play is also just gone. The load-out system is odd and a bit pointless - why would I ever use the PP-Bizon or Sawed-Off over any other SMG or shotgun? It just made these guns you would buy on a whim utterly useless since they now take a slot where an objectively better gun could've been. The M249 has now become even more redundant. Also, any previously downloaded matches are gone, so now you can no longer watch them. Isn't this game supposed to be a sequel/upgrade to CS:GO? Why are there ZERO new maps/weapons? I'm sure in time they'll add back some of the missing things I complained about since Baggage is literally featured in a screenshot on the store page, but for now, it's seriously lacking.  4 months later - Arms Race is back with a whopping TWO MAPS!",603.5,Not Recommended,"1,898 people found this review helpful

730,2018-06-16 00:00:00,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta. It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also. I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!!  It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service. It's funny how things happen!!  Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad. There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me. Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from. The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!). Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy? If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for??? Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).  My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.? There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service? It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?! Who know's? Certainly nobody in the community, why? No communication. Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to? A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.  Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.  Cheers Chris  P.S. UPDATE - My hours are incorrect. My pc is never off for other reasons and CS is running in the background idling just like my AV. Save your time if you were going to post a comment about my hours, pleeaaasee","20,509.3",Recommended,"490 people found this review helpful

Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours. When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees. Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly. Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess. Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.",128.3,Recommended,"320 people found this review helpful

730,2024-09-21 00:00:00,"The suffering I’ve endured from playing Counter-Strike is a complex blend of mental, emotional, and even physical pain. It begins with the countless hours spent grinding in competitive matches, where every loss feels like a personal failure, a reflection of my inadequacies. I’ve experienced the gut-wrenching agony of getting matched with teammates who seem to have no regard for teamwork or strategy, leaving me to carry the game on my own shoulders. The weight of that responsibility crushes my spirit, especially when I still lose despite my best efforts. Every missed shot feels like a betrayal of my own hands, a reminder that no matter how many hours I pour into improving my aim or game sense, there are still moments where I am utterly powerless. The suffocating tension of a 1v1 clutch situation is something I’ve felt in my bones, the pressure building as the seconds tick away, my palms sweating, heart racing, only to die to some sniper crouching in a corner, completely erasing any hope of victory.  The toxicity of the community adds another layer to the pain. It’s not just the personal failures; it’s the verbal abuse that follows. No matter how well I play, there’s always that one teammate who’s quick to hurl insults, to tear down whatever little confidence I’ve built. The constant barrage of blame, the accusations that I’m throwing the game or that I’m a noob, gnaws away at my self-esteem. Every match feels like a battlefield, not just against the enemy team but against my own squad, fighting to maintain my mental stability while being bombarded by insults, racial slurs, and unnecessary aggression. Then there’s the pain of seeing a perfectly executed strategy fall apart due to one small mistake, whether it's a missed flashbang or an ill-timed push. The frustration builds with every game, the crushing realization that even though I’ve spent hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours in the game, I’m still not where I want to be skill-wise.  Physically, the game has taken its toll as well. My back and wrists ache from sitting in the same position for hours, hunched over, eyes glued to the screen, fingers moving in a precise, rapid-fire rhythm. The late nights have robbed me of sleep, leaving me exhausted, but I can’t stop playing because I’m chasing that one good game, that fleeting moment of victory that keeps me coming back, even though deep down I know that satisfaction will never outweigh the frustration. Counter-Strike has become a cycle of suffering, where each win is quickly overshadowed by a string of losses, and every moment of joy is drowned out by the ever-present, gnawing feeling of defeat.  10/10",686.9,Recommended,"226 people found this review helpful

730,2023-03-05 00:00:00,"Playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is like playing a game of chess, except instead of pawns and bishops, you have AK-47s and grenades. And instead of a calm, calculated opponent, you have a bunch of 13-year-old kids screaming into their mics. But despite all that, this game can be a lot of fun. There's nothing quite like the thrill of defusing a bomb with 0.001 seconds left on the clock, or the satisfaction of getting a headshot on someone who's been trash-talking you all game. And let's not forget the joy of accidentally shooting your own teammate in the back and getting kicked from the game. All in all, if you're looking for a game that will make you question your own sanity, while also providing hours of entertainment, then Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the game for you.

You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own.  Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.  You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.  Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.  You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'.  You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO.

Valve you are actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retarded what the ♥♥♥♥ Here's literally the simplest way we can tell you how to fix this: - Fix VAC - Fix Prime - Fix Bugs - Don't put a BR into a competitive FPS game - And don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ make the game free to play and then give everyone a coin for being retarded and actually buying this game.  There was zero communication between CSGO and the players, you legit just asked if we were free Wednesday, and now I wish I was busy so I never would of have to play this.  EDIT: A more structured, critical review.  I decided to try the game again to give a better review rather than just lashing out at what I saw earlier, and in a completely honest way, I'm still unhappy, but not as unhappy as I was prior. I still love this game if it is not evident by the number of hours that I have on my account. But still, I have some critiques on this.  The Battle Royale When I heard the idea of a battle royale in CS, I was against it, they've never quite been my thing and the popularity of games like fortnite completely destroyed any hope that I had for battle royales in games. However, CSGO's battle royale does have some pros with some cons at the same time. Do take into account that I am biased against battle royales. Pros: - It's a fresh new take on the battle royale genre. - Thing like escorting hostages add a great addition to the game mode as a way to get money whilst still being involved with anything around you. - The idea of choosing and seeing where others drop is a nice feature.  Cons (take into account I am biased against battle royales): - It doesn't fit well into a CS game, yes I understand that I don't have to play it but it does my head in that it's advertised on the main screen. - Ammo is actually harder to find than real life aliens, the fact that you pick ammo up 1 by 1 doesn't make this any easier. - Drones break if there is a ledge near where you are standing. I bought some ammo and the drone was confused if an inanimate wall was actually me. - The amount of actual shake you receive when getting hit is akin to an earthquake, given I had some fun with my friends going around and bashing people to the point where it's like the Negev in warmup. - Finally, it's a battle royale. You didn't have to follow this trend CS, even if it was planned a while ago.  Free To Play This is one of the more concerning things that I had with the update, CS is already filled with cheaters and can sometimes make the game so irritating that I've put it down for a couple weeks. As 3kliksphilip said its probably the game with the most cheaters (Does CS:GO Updates not entertain you) But now I have some confidence in their decision for making it free to play, it allows more people to experience CS and will most likely double the population which isn't a downside. The thought that Valve has made the game free to play shows that they have confidence in VAC and that VAC will learn a lot more things due to the games new state.  Prime This issue is one of the main reasons that this review is staying as not recommended. The idea that you can pay into prime and that people who have already bought the game will now have instant prime. This kind of makes me think that prime will be reduced to a standard trust factor match which cheaters are somewhat abundant. But if Valve is confident enough in their VAC, this shouldn't be a problem. However, the amount of cheaters who have probably been grinding enough to get prime on multiple accounts is worrying.  Valve in General My issue with prime has nothing on this. Valve don't really know much about their audience. We believe that we are entitled due to the amount of ♥♥♥♥ they have given us in the past years (AUG Week, R8's introduction *solved quickly, nerfing weapon speeds *this affected pros but they can manage now, #HikoMissed). My problem isn't really with this, it's with Valve's transparency, they never tell us what they're going to do and expect us to all love their new idea like its Chef Boyardee's canned pasta. No one has really ever asked for battle royale in CS, we ask for improvements which are normally disregarded.  In short, I'm upset with this update, but not as upset as I once was, I still have faith in Valve although it is withering at a fast pace.  Response to comments: @PapaNotedVevo: Agreed that it makes the player base bigger, dislike the concept of battle royale in cs. @JustSqueeze: Cause why can't I? As long as I have skins and fun with my friends then who cares? @Count Chocula: H1Z1s peak player base was 150,179, it's now 24-hour peak is averaging the 3,000 range. This isn't good for a game, it puts people off from the original concept. @thehemmo: Yeah I agree with you now my man. @waffle.jpeg: I won't play it, I'm not being forced to. It's a bad addition to a competitive game and I won't play it anymore, regarding optimization, I'm glad you can run this on your 12 year old labtop as you said. And yeah I was probably wrong about the optimization thing, some of my friends with lower-end pc's still cannot run it. @RandyCo: Prime isn't mean to be something you can pay for, prime is meant to be for people who have played the long enough and deserve a place where they can play without cheaters, cool VACnet is enabled, I forgot that gets rid of every cheater ever, did you?  I just miss source man, the games only full priced because valve can't afford to make Gmod assets free. If Source-style movement was back in the game, I wouldn't care what happens.","1,480.3",Not Recommended,"4,617 people found this review helpful

Add them to a mixing bowl.  Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.  Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.  Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.  While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.  Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.  Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.  Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.  Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.  Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.  Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.  Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.  At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.  Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO:  1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid' 2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'  Within a month - Within a week -  1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because ""Oh, It's only 30p"" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back. 2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting. Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.  The community is with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself.  But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug.

730,2019-01-12 00:00:00,"I have always been a supporter of this game. Such depth and reward when learning and improving at this game during my 10+ years of play. The same goes for previous renditions of this game.  However, I have to give this game my first ever bad review. I believe CSGO has entered the worst state it has ever been in. This is due to the cheating in this game. The entire community is nervous. 90% of games turns into salty game of people blaming everyone of cheating. Sportsmanship is fading. Play one good game you get reported and end up in low trust factor. The developers give no CLEAR information on how this works and what to do to remedy it. Updates of this game is slow and not focused on improving the game state. Last contributing factor is the increasing amount of cheating in pro level games. As a whole it feels that my immediate contacts more or less feels the same and the ""FUN"" factor of the game is just disappearing.  I am slowly starting to lose my respect for this game and might end up leaving CS for good. I sincerely hope this gets fixed soon, as I would like to see this world of CS that has given me so many hours of fun and endless gr8 memories to grow and keep growing.

730,2017-07-20 00:00:00,"You want buy this game ? I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing : - Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot. - If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??","1,047.8",Recommended,"1,013 people found this review helpful

730,2017-01-29 00:00:00,"**UPDATED REVIEW (05/05/2018) LOOK BELOW **  Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this game  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played... but I still love it  Why? well let me tell ya  I've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage, happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc.  This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on.  Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways.  What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''? Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc, Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying.  Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong time  If you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky.  now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealing  Well, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage.  So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it   -Datsuke 1/29/2017   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- **UPDATE**  Okay, it's been more than a year from my original review, Have I changed my thoughts?.. Sort of.  The game haven't recieved much love from Valve, and Prime matchmaking is still in beta, about Prime matchmaking, for some reason the lobbies always default to trust factor which is horrible, and to my knowledge you cannot make it Prime as default (correct me if I'm wrong).  The community is pretty much the same, nothing has changed on that note.  Now, I have more complains on matchmaking: I used to think that the game itself is broken, I really did, I thought that the hitboxes were messed up (which I have a video example of that, that I recorded myself here: watch it if you wish) but really what is really broken are the matchmaking servers, how do I know this? Well, I been wanting to take the game a little more serious, so I signed up for ESEA which is a paid suscription to other servers that are basically competitive games, the difference here is that the matchmaking servers are 64 tick and the ESEA servers are 128 tick, which is a world of a difference, everything is more accurate when is about headshots and all of that good stuff, and I believe ESEA has more servers so my ping on matchmaking is usually 60-80ms on ESEA servers is around 20-35ms. On ESEA the ranking isn't **AS** broken as matchmaking and the community on ESEA takes the game pretty seriously and don't mess around, which I really like that, however the problem is that it is a paid suscription which not everyone is willing to pay, so there's also FACEIT which provides the same service as ESEA but for free, however Faceit has premium features but payment is not obligated to play.  So, the game is pretty much the same, not many fixes or changes going on, but I wanted to update this review since these third-party services change the game experience dramatically and make the game generally more enjoyable, so give those a try and they make help you like the game a little more, at least it worked for me.  -Datsuke 05/05/2018","2,223.4",Recommended,"309 people found this review helpful

730,2013-12-31 00:00:00,"I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.  I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.  I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind.  My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.  I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.  Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.  My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.  Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.  The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.  _   Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.  Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.  Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.  I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.  I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.  The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.  My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.  I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.  I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.  Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.  A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.  Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.  _   Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat.  Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""  Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.  From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.  The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.  Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.  Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.  Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.  Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.  I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.  I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.","3,403.1",Recommended,"2,539 people found this review helpful

730,2023-08-29 00:00:00,"Well it looks as though Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is coming to an end soon. It makes me sad to think about. This game has had a big impact on my life. I've been playing since the game came out, countless memories. This here video game has to be one of the most refined games i have ever played. Using of the heart of Quake; CS:GO has proven to be the best FPS to date. CS:GO accomplishes so much. This game lets gun play become art. Its almost as if every spray you preform is a unique signature or tag. The guns are consistent and balanced in an refreshing way. Beyond gun play there is the movement. Bunny hopping, surfing, air-strafing, long-jumping. All of these incredible feature with an almost infinite skill ceiling. Zoom out again you have excellent maps, developer and community made. Each map featuring a unique history and lore. If we take another step back from the basic game play CSGO has Skins, and oh baby do i like skins. The style and progression of concept throughout the years. A flourishing economy of trade. Interesting stickers and personal ones that hold the value of a team or moment in time. All of these beautiful ideas and feature of CSGO are blended into this master craft of a video game. I mean i'm barely scratching the surface of depth there is to this iconic online shooter, but i will end this mindless rant with one last appreciation. The developers have stuck with the soul of the community from the start of this game. They have listened and acted with and for the players. Valve has always understood what it means to host a game of this nature, and they should be acknowledged for it. So from one of those players, genuinely, Thank you Valve!","3,041.3",Recommended,"670 people found this review helpful

730,2014-06-07 00:00:00,"In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in.  When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body.  The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.  Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.  In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders.  Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.",76.9,Recommended,"3,276 people found this review helpful

730,2018-12-07 00:00:00,"Honest review of an (nearly) 15 year player  Game has come a long way. SInce very first CS up to this point. Current trends actually killed this game for good. I don't think I will ever come back to it. I can't imagine going F2P on this game is a good idea purely because of cheaters and scummy players. Matchmaking is awful as is thus i see no reason to TRY to have fun playing. Battle royale? I am waiting for new Need for Speed to have that gamemode too (kappa). I don't know, I am honestly disappointed, once again by this game. Best FPS ever made has actually hit rock bottom by not being itself anymore EDIT I can see that people who have the same opinion as me are usually more experienced, whereas people that are basically new and have under 2 years of playtime would just be toxic and be part of this /perfect cancer-free/ community.

730,2017-12-01 00:00:00,"This game is one of those games that you could say you're quitting and even go the length of deleting it. But for some odd reason you will come back to this game, whether it takes days or months. 10/10  Edit: I'm finally managing to get myself out of this terrible relationship. xD  Edit #2: I wish I could say I've been enjoying this game again, but honestly. I really haven't, I'm still going to leave it in the recommended category because of how many hours I've sunk into it. But new players are going to have a terrible time unless they fork over 15$ to get upgraded to prime. Otherwise have fun trying to get to rank 21 when there is at least one hacker every other if not every game.","1,827.8",Recommended,"127 people found this review helpful

730,2013-12-14 00:00:00,"I purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours. It was absolute crap and I uninstalled it.  Fast forward just about one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version.  The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99.  If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.  ****  Coming back to edit the review many years later, CSGO has gone free to play and has improved a lot over the years. Glad to see the game is still kicking strong.","1,560.8",Recommended,147 people found this review helpful 1

730,2024-11-03 00:00:00,"Alright, I've been playing CS since 1.6. I know CS:GO had a rough first year after release, but CS2 really is something else. As someone that used to do tournaments and events with a team as a former semi-pro back in the day, this game has steered so far to terrible that it's just not worth wasting time on until it's in a proper playable state. It's a shell of what once was one of the most optimised FPS's out there and many other current pro players and former pro players will tell you the same thing. If you have a ping above 20, forget about it. The glitches, the cheaters, the lack of network utilisation, the lack of support for content creators, the deceit etc.. There's just so much wrong with this game right now. This review may change later, but I'm dead sick of trying to enjoy it as it once was. Perhaps it's my fault for moving over to Starlink, perhaps I'm getting old, or perhaps the years beforehand were my imagination, but no, it's not the case because others have the exact same issues and it seems Valve has turned a blind eye to them.","2,756.7",Not Recommended,"322 people found this review helpful

730,2022-03-02 00:00:00,"I had a girlfriend before I played this game, but after I downloaded this game, I received a phone call from her saying she found a new person and was leaving me. I was devastated. So I started grinding on this game 24/7. It became natural for me. I couldn't put this game down. I sold my brother on eBay just for money to buy skins. Eventually I played so much till my fingers fell off. Then my hands fell off. My arms and legs came off next. Next thing I knew, I was just a human chicken nugget. I still play this game every single day for a minimum of 25 hours a day and play with my tongue on my keyboard and my belly button on the mouse. I was basically twerking every time I moved my mouse.

730,2020-12-17 00:00:00,"Death in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an invaluable instructor. As a long-standing tradition in the series, failure serves as the ultimate lesson, revealing the paths not taken, the mistakes made, and the opportunities for improvement. It stands as the most captivating, exasperating, and gratifying game I've ever experienced. Dedicated Counter-Strike players invest substantial time in acquiring knowledge, resulting in continuous personal growth. In Global Offensive, progression holds immense significance, particularly for newcomers or those returning after a hiatus. This unyieldingly intense, skill-driven first-person shooter compels players to adopt a distinctive mindset unlike that of contemporary shooters. If you hail from the Call of Duty realm, adapting your gameplay style becomes imperative for success in Counter-Strike. Furthermore, Counter-Strike endeavors to evolve by implementing slight changes, while remaining faithful to its core strengths. By revamping familiar maps and introducing fresh official modes, Global Offensive revitalizes the gameplay, offering veterans new challenges and encouraging novel play styles—a remarkable feat after nearly 15 years of the franchise's existence.","3,655.4",Recommended,"152 people found this review helpful

730,2018-12-06 00:00:00,"Games been out for 8 years, riddled with skids and delusional cheaters... Let's make it free to play and easier for cheaters to get into prime by dropping a PRIME STATUS UPGRADE FOR 19.99 instead of continuing to ban cheater's phone numbers, and making them actually have to play the game before they ruin it for others.  Also let's drop a BR mode without any sort of anti-cheat beyond VAC. Good job Valve, day you killed the game.  edit- It’s 2018, we live in a day and age when your ads are tracking and monitoring you. F* off and man up and bring back the intrusive AC. Do what ESEA does but better for f* sakes. Take control of your game. Give us what we want, 128 tick MM. Stop killing off games when you run out of ideas or don’t want to exhaust funds to make them better. This is Counterstrike we are talking about.  Also fair play and up for debate... Announce when you’re about to drop the major AC overhaul. That way, the people who are stuck in MM cheating because they feel like they have no alternative, or have genuinely given up on the game, can finally go clean when they see the positive of a clean competitive game. Knowing that if they do it again in the new day and age of CS, they will be HWID banned. Then drop the hammer.  You don’t need to spend all this money on some A.I. to save your PR department from the horrors of an “intrusive anti-cheat” who cares... save the f*ing game first.","1,248.0",Not Recommended,"2,526 people found this review helpful

730,2014-12-18 00:00:00,"I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.  The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken.  I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator.

730,2017-02-13 00:00:00,"You want to buy this game ? I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing: - Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot. - If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??","1,363.0",Recommended,"418 people found this review helpful

730,2013-11-25 00:00:00,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.  In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.  The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.  Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.  There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.","5,182.5",Recommended,"4,590 people found this review helpful

730,2024-10-08 00:00:00,"After nearly 8,000 hours in cs:go, I think it's only fair to commit to saying that I am thoroughly disappointed with CS2. The game has taken the gripping core concept of a counter-strike game, and built around it with the primary goal of building esports and cosmetic frameworks to generate revenue. There have been numerous requests for changes that should have been prioritized, with no exaggeration, since 2015. Anti-cheat and tickrate have been eschewed to spend time developing cosmetics and designing gameplay within the skins economy rather than engaging with the gameplay of the core game. And with all this extra revenue, you really can't afford 128 tick, even just for premier or paying premier players?  The disrespect the continued non-development of the game itself reflects upon the community and the spirit that keeps the game alive should long ago have fractioned the playerbase, but the way back has been walled off by removing csgo from steam (possibly one of the most dishonest, anti-consumer moves i've ever seen). There is nothing honest going on at valve when it comes to cs2, and nothing elevating this game beyond a general shooter other than the allowance from valve for us measly customers to still interact with the core mechanics of counter-strike. perhaps they'll slowly sculpt this game into something decent, but the philosophy and principles pushing the counter-strike project at valve have long since left the realm of mechanics and passion for greener* pastures.","8,606.9",Not Recommended,"146 people found this review helpful

730,2017-03-08 00:00:00,"CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.  CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime-matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve.  Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play.  Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general.  Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some game-modes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!  Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates.","2,416.2",Recommended,"299 people found this review helpful

730,2014-12-20 00:00:00,"So I have played this game for a couple years now with a break of 8 months between it because of some updates who got me from MGE back to the silvers..  So now I am back at it again and I am kinda in love again. Yes I also think they should change the VAC and Cooldown system, because it is pretty ♥♥♥♥ atm. But if you just play the game like you should play it, it is a pretty good game.  Before my pause I spend a ♥♥♥♥ load of money on skins, i had a ♥♥♥♥ load, I sold them all and at this point I only use the skins I get dropt in game or didnt sold.  So the latest update ( adding wingman and scoutgame) I think thats pretty good. Only thing is they should change the wingman stuff. Because I played a couple times against people who are Global on competive so that is nog fair yet. Also the cooldown system should be sepperate.  but the game is good.","2,299.7",Recommended,"88 people found this review helpful

Now, six years later, the fast-paced PC game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles, partly because of its established core gameplay and active community. Visually, however, CS: GO is starting to show its age and it's not as thematically rich as other popular titles, such as Overwatch.

730,2014-03-15 00:00:00,"I came to this game for my fetish of chickens. When playing the game, I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect. I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now, Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore.. I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the chickens. Ah, It was so good. Chickens I love them Oh Chickens THANK YOU GABEN 5/5 I love chickens.","3,291.6",Recommended,"1,808 people found this review helpful

730,2022-04-30 00:00:00,"CS:GO came out over 3,500 days ago, almost 10 years. Since 2014, CS:GO has never had less than 250,000 concurrent players. Many games in the last decade which are considered cornerstones of PC gaming, possibly even cornerstones of FPS games in general, never even achieved that many concurrent players at their absolute peak. In 2020, CS:GO hit its all time peak of over a million concurrent players playing all at the same time, an achievement that is likely only shared with truly Earth-shatteringly popular games like LoL and WoW. This is all to say that somehow, despite being almost a decade old, CS:GO remains one of the most popular titles on PC as a whole, beating out such rivals as Apex Legends, Valorant, Warzone, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, and pretty much every other FPS game you can let roll off the tongue, and likely any non-shooter title you can think of as well. I would venture to say that no game aside from Minecraft and PONG has had even remotely close to the staying power of CS:GO.  All that said, the game blows. Modern CS:GO looks dated, sounds dated, and plays like Valve's 1998 Half-Life. Source has completely knee-capped any opportunity for growth and innovation, and with a few minor meta changes and the introduction of new gamemodes and weapons, CS:GO is the same game now that it was 3,500 days ago. Some would argue that this is a sign of perfection, of effortless staying power, but I would argue that it is a sign of a lazy cash grab. Let's be honest, in comparison to modern competitors, CS:GO's movement is incredibly clunky. You can draw a direct lineage between crouch-jumping mid-doors on Dust II to completing puzzles in Black Mesa in Half Life. CS:GO is likely the only game about using firearms that does not allow you to ADS and more or less guarantees the user that the bullets coming from their firearm will not hit what they are looking at unless they have perfect movement, aim, and spray-pattern knowledge. Very few weapons have been added in the last decade, and those that have been added are generally worse in every measurable way to those that they replace. Dust II remains the most popular map and has itself only seen a light graphical upgrade with only a small handful of map design changes. New maps are introduced, regularly complained about, and removed from the current map pool. If you are reading this in 2032, Dust II is likely still the most popular map and likely remains un-upgraded.  Socially, the game is terrible. The vast majority of the user base is either incredibly toxic, racist, cheating, or a combination of all three. The way that matchmaking works, it is easy to come across smurf after smurf after smurf, losing game after game after game to players who's real skill is likely 10x higher than CS:GO placed them. I cannot begin to count the number of games in which I was subjected to player's profile pictures that were outright pornographic or I was called racial or homophobic slurs. ""Toxic"" does not even begin to describe how inhumane the CS:GO community can be at times.  So thus far, I have established that CS:GO is one of the most popular games on PC that has time and time again outlasted better competitors, I have dogpiled the game for looking, sounding, and playing like a game from 1998, and I have called all of the userbase toxic cheaters. If I believe all of these things, how can I possibly recommend the game? Easy - I only play CS:GO with friends. I play for fun and to collect skins. Many an hour has been spent, three or four beers deep, just chatting and joking with friends with CS:GO on in the background. Three, four, or even five-stacking pub matches is incredible fun. Playing the game in a public lobby where you and your friends work through elaborate, practiced routines of memes and jokes with poor, unsuspecting randoms is easily one of the funniest things you can do with a microphone and PC. Stupendous fun can be had when you find a player who has a sense of humor who will joke around with you as much as you with them. Every game is a win when you play with friends - you either lose the game so that your skill rating drops and you get to pub stomp the next lobby, or you win the game and your skill rating increases so that you can get pub stomped next game, thus setting you up for your own pub stomp. This circuitous motion is what keeps the game fun and fresh, you either get dumpstered on, dumpster a team, or the CS:GO matchmaking works for once and you have to fight for your life to get that 15:15. CS:GO sucks as a game, and you will never, ever see me playing it alone. But as a medium by which you can interact with your friends, CS:GO is unbeatable. Put a 30-rack in the fridge, get some T-Bell delivered, and get four friends who cannot hit the accept button with their aim and I guarantee you will make a life-long meme between the five of you.",754.3,Recommended,"252 people found this review helpful

730,2023-10-14 00:00:00,"This game got replaced. The reviews are from cs:go which was a way better game. They replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game.  CS 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps, community servers, battle royale, surf, zombies mods and more. Additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when I cannot play at all which never happened in cs:go. This game is incomplete and shouldn't take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully. New graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasn't worth it. I was hyped for CS 2 but it's not ready to replace CS: GO and they shouldn't remove an existing game and turn off CS:GO servers, it should be just a separate game as it always was with CS series.  I feel scammed especially that I bought CS:GO when it was still a paid game. They took a game I paid for and replaced with some silly remake.",311.6,Not Recommended,"291 people found this review helpful

730,2021-02-11 00:00:00,"This game saved my life.  I am 42.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you","2,096.8",Recommended,"562 people found this review helpful

730,2018-07-19 00:00:00,"I don't think we can say CS:GO is a game anymore - It's a sport. I fully got into this game through the competitive esport side, watching my favourite teams and players compete is just amazing and I think this has to be the most gripping, exciting sport to watch due the the unpredictablility.  You can't deny that Counter-Strike has the best shooter mechanics of any game out there, and the tactical side is genius. Being a skilled aimer does not get you nearly as far as being smart and knowing all of the maps better than your opponent.  It really is sad that CS:GO has made such a bad name for itself due to the gambling issues and Valve's lack of cooperation, but somehow it is still one of the most played games on the platform.  Counter-Strike excites me and it will 100% excite anyone who gets fully into it, because you can never beat the game.","2,080.5",Recommended,"134 people found this review helpful

730,2023-10-19 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike 2...Disappointing is an understatement.  Valves release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2012 was a disaster that took YEARS before the game was competitively polished. Fast forward 11 years and Valve is mirroring their routine with another disgraceful release. Even more laughable is the fact that their company assets and resources have more than tripled in those 11 years.  What the community PRIMARILY wanted with cs2: 1. Anti-cheat that actually works 2. 128 tick servers for MM 3. A better MM system (not relevant if the AC doesn't work)  What the community got with cs2: - map collision - player collision - ""subtick"" masking 64 tick - bad audio, inferior movement - frame drops, poorly optimized - awful hitreg & interp / dying behind walls / getting kills when your crosshair isn't on the enemy - The anti-cheat doesn't work.

This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.  The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.  The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo.  There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.    ◘ Match Making. ◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level. ◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments. ◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard. ◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game. ◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter. ◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch! ◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.    ◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved. ◘ Game could use some optimization here and there. ◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.","11,190.7",Recommended,"2,409 people found this review helpful

Dedicated servers with more than 10 people don't have hit registration or choke/latency issues in the slightest. Community is filled with mentally stable, rational, humble players dedicated to having fun while improving, not merely ranking up and flaming enemies and/or teammates. VAC is literally flawless on this game, never before have I encounted someone who I think twice about being absolutely 100% legitimate. CS:GO developers have truly pruned this game into the best FPS of all time with their consistent efforts into listening to the community, bringing regular updates, game balancing patches and exciting new operations into Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  Also goes well while coming down from a weeklong amphetamine induced psychosis.

Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this. I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was ""only a kid."" Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair.

Hard work starts to pay off and just when you think this is not going so bad, kqly appears from nowhere with his freecsgocheats.com and stomps you with no remorse. You uninstall. Months later get drunk and think its a good idea to download csgo and so the cycle begins once more.","1,076.1",Recommended,"165 people found this review helpful

730,2020-04-25 00:00:00,"I must say the experience is so bad that the Chinese are so proud of cheating in a game with prime status. I don't feel there are any actions on handling the cheaters to protect the gaming environment. Feeling sad for the other players trying so hard to improve their skills.  For those doubting that I met some Chinese cheater but not somebody who acts like a Chinese, I guess their smooth, simplified Chinese is good evidence to prove they are the same nation of people.  I understand not every Chinese player accepts this kind of bad game behavior, feeling sad that their reputations are getting worse by those rude people with no sense.  Besides, I understand some of the Chinese players may blame this comment and claim it is a baseless accusation. I am not trying to argue anything, as they don't have my experience, and I don't have theirs. I am just leaving the text area open for those with the same feelings.","1,110.2",Not Recommended,"68 people found this review helpful

730,2015-08-22 00:00:00,"Hello and welcome, new player. Allow me to reveal some of the likely outcomes of you purchasing this game:  The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking ♥♥♥♥♥, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games. Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along.  Habitat: Dust2  The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency, most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket.  Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache  The 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub.  Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation Maps  The 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 5000 hours - 30 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win'  Habitat: Mothers basement  11/10 would play again.","4,296.9",Recommended,"280 people found this review helpful

730,2019-01-24 00:00:00,"ANSWER A COMMON AND IMPORTANT QUESTION Is there really much cheater in this game?  Well, the truth cannot be hidden ... Many big hackers, due to the excessive popularity of this game, update their cheats daily and provide it to a many of players.  But the main problem is that many times we do not face cheaters we face We face low self-esteem, low morale and low skills  From one level onwards, the players are so well prepared that we think the other side must be cheated to be able to aim our heads from a long distance with just one shot ak 47 in a very short time. Instead of grumbling, raise your level  anyway cs go is one of the best classic shooters that does not become obsolete due to its attractive and unique mechanism  Let me be honest with you!

730,2016-02-03 00:00:00,"Apart from being primarily a game, made for entertainment and competitive purposes, CS:GO is also a powerful personal development tool. Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following:  - It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's insults opinions. ""Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake."" - It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores. - It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. ""Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle."" - It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong. - It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while.  Of course, as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members, none of this will happen on its own--unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit.",828.5,Recommended,"63 people found this review helpful

Lowest settings don't give you any fps boost, but greatly ruin the quality - Random weapon spread, sometimes you hit everything, sometimes you don't hit anything. AK might sometimes feel impossible to spray with, tracers do not represent ACTUAL bullets' trajectory, movement is bad and inconsistent Enemy models are floating, Fps drops when you shoot or enemy peeks you - Developers removed convenient features like CL_righthand 0, and cl_bob settings, you can't turn off tracers that really ♥♥♥♥ up your muscle memory - Low ping has never been stronger, you can no longer hold angles, because you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up by anyone who peeks, especially with lower ping - All my friends gave up on this ♥♥♥♥ game, I gave it a chance, but it has been 3 months and they haven't fixed anything important, they just slightly improved performance CS was the only game I wasn't tired playing, I really enjoyed comptetition, but now it means nothing to me","4,381.9",Not Recommended,81 people found this review helpful 2

You can call me ""bad"" ""Terrible"" ""They're just better"" But iv been playing since 2013, I know who is legit and who is blatantly cheating.  Project A will not kill csgo, Its very different, looks more like overwatch. Im not afraid of csgo dying, but what i am worried about is new players dealing with cheating, Getting annoyed and then cheat themselves. This is why there are so many cheaters. VAC is not a good anti cheat.  I do not recommend buying prime unless your willing to deal with 5 days of cheaters, then hopefully having a good trust factor where there are no cheaters.   Valve, You should really implement a trust factor XP bar, or something so you can tell if yours is good or not. The current system is broken, You sometimes have cheaters with new accounts, and sometimes 5 year old players who are obviously not cheating. The current system is broken and needs to be fixed.  If you still sit here and think this is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ill link a video soon, I bought a new account, and played 1 game, All good no cheaters, Played another one. Spinbotters who crash the server so they dont get Overwatched because it corrupts the demo. I have proof for all of this.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Initial Review  Counterstrike is and always will be a amazing game. The reason its having its downfalls is due to the 78% of the community uses cheats. VAC is the WORST anti cheat there is out there, This is something a 12 year old could bypass in his computer class at school. You can code walls in less than 1 hour. Theres nothing protecting this game!!!!  VALVE project A will DESTROY CSGO if you do not implement another anti cheat. EAC is better than this garbage.  Honestly dont waste your money on this game if you have no trust factor or low, Queing with people who have Low Trustfactor is the worst thing you can do. Its all cheaters who HVH in MM.  I suggest removing Trust Factor or fix it. I que with someone who gets a 7 day due to kicking players who ♥♥♥♥ around in comp then he has Low Trust Factor, Then we que with hackers.  Please for ♥♥♥♥ Sakes valve fix your game. Remove these scums so us LEGIT old players actually have a fun time instead of leaving this game..  THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH PURCHASING DO NOT PLAY IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE GOOD TRUST FACTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","2,489.4",Not Recommended,"129 people found this review helpful

I cannot remember that much from when I first got the game, but it went something like this:  Play one game-quit-next day-play one game-quit, and that went on for a little while. Now that I am a little older and know the game better then I did just 6-7 years ago, I can tell you what I like and dislike about this game.  Starting with what I like about this game: I like that there is a solid community around the game, though there is alot of scammers/hackers/others, but there is always someone kind just around the corner.  When I started playing CS I liked the pistols on CT cause I felt like I was in the police force. I also liked the AWP and the Ak-47 cause of the insane damage I got with it. I did not really use the other guns, but other people played better with it.  The game felt really good at the start and I was ready to become a pro. Getting a rank was not a big deal for me at the time, only playing Deathmatch or Gun Game most of the time. I cannot even remember my first ever rank.  My tips to new players: Do not care about what rank you get. Start by having fun and playing on your own level.  After watching a lot of videos on how to get better and improve this and that, I started playing more seriously. Changing my settings to what the pros had, Using other crosshairs, viewmodels and such. I started playing better and doing better on the scoreboard.  I started warming up everyday to keep me on the level I was. Playing with friends that have good game sence and microphones, and having good communication was the key to a better experience and a happy rankup.  Youtubers that posts tips and tricks:     And there is a lot more people that posts tips and tricks.  What I dislike about the game:  Starting with Hackers. There is always going to be some kind of cheaters in CS and that it's hard for valve to ban them all, but I think they could do better. The amount of hackers I meet on a daily bases is just insane, example wingman. In wingman there is atleast one hacker in 1-3 matches, and I have reported so many of them and up to 20% of they have been banned but up to 80% of they still allowed to play on valve secured servers. This is a problem.  Toxic. You may have heard the word toxic before, you may even be toxic. There is alot of players that are toxic, saying bad words to you, been hateful towards you, telling you that you are bad and things like that. This is a problem that will never be solved, just because of how many plays the game and how many people that gets mad if someone is bad or you losing a game. Toxic players is hard to deal with and you have to either mute him or just try to talk to him in a normal way.  Scammers. Scammers is also a thing that ruins the game for most people. To lose alot of money because of a scammer is not the most fun thing on this planet. it has happened to me aswell, loseing over $200 cause of a scam is not fun at all. Thats why you always should double check every trade you do. (Don't trust people over the internet)  I love operations, but it takes so long before the next operation, so we just sit and wait for over 1 year... This is something that makes me a little angry. CS is the same over and over again and that is not a bad thing, but we would love to sit back and relax with a operation.  Overall I like this game and I think you would like it aswell.  Thanks.

730,2020-04-08 00:00:00,"My Thoughts and Opinions on CS:GO CS:Go is one of those games that has a really dedicated and rabid fanbase thanks to incredible success of Counter Strike 1.6. Released in 2012 and eight years later, the fast-paced PC game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles, partly because of its established core gameplay and huge active community. A big part of its success is due to its massive esports following. It’s always talked about in streaming sites whether its Twitch and Mixer. The game even includes its own ""watch a match"" section so you can follow and spectate live tournaments and competitive matches. CS:GO is also very easily accessible. It’s free and all you need is a potato with a fine keyboard and mouse and maybe a headset with a mic. It runs on basically any PC with decent frames rate. A High-End PC should give you over 300fps at ultra-details. You don’t need anything fancy or powerful to enjoy which is another reason why there’s so big player base.  +Valve has done everything it can to evolve the game and keep it fresh by staying true to the series. +One of the greatest competitive first-person shooters you can play on Steam +Massive player base and a game that refuses to die! +Includes several maps and nine game modes types including the standard team based PvP casual modes, competitive, deathmatch, arms race, community made maps and servers and even a 16 player Battle Royale mode (but you shouldn’t really play it for Battle Royale as its mostly barebones and ugly). +100% skill-based gameplay and no casual power-ups like seen in Halos and Call of Duty. +CS: GO relies heavily on reaction time and twitchy movements. Thus, line-of-sight is one of the biggest advantages you can create. +Excellent sound design (but very unrealistic at the same time). +Bullet physics and explosions are still impressive for an engine that is now 16 years old. +Excellent performance. Runs well even on potatoes and 10-year-old PCs and laptops. +An example of “games as a service” done well.  -Well, you’ll often find some gamers helpful and tolerable to newbies, the mass playerbase is unwelcoming and very toxic. Playing without friends is not recommended. -Negative behavior includes trolls in the team chats, people who scream into their mics, and people who simply can't keep quiet :D Some of them might even vote to kick you out because you're new to CS. -Plenty of hackers and cheaters that ruin the fun and fair-play for everyone. VAC engine is mostly automated and not moderated by Valve's employees unless during a few rare cases. The anti-cheat is okay but not any better than other anti-cheat solutions seen on PC. So yeah! Cheating exist nearly everywhere these days. -Technically CS:Go looks very dated and mediocre. It hasn’t changed a lot from CS: Source. The graphics are mediocre and 2008ish. Graphics haven’t improved relatively much since 2004’s Half Life 2. -Aggressive monetization to the point it’s become a live gambling show. Players can choose to spend real money on items and cosmetic material like weapon skins. Winning and completing tasks rewards you loot boxes that can be unlocked by purchasing keys with real money!!! Too much trading could even lead to online gambling addiction.  CS:GO is one of the most fine-tuned first-person shooters to date. Sure, while it may look like a 15-year-old game and there might be major issues, but the fact that the community is thriving speaks volumes, this means that this game will constantly be tweaked towards perfection.",723.9,Recommended,"166 people found this review helpful

730,2018-07-02 00:00:00,"Ahh... CSGO, i know i know what u think when csgo pop ups <HACKERS>, yeah i hate them too, and yeah it is to be known that csgo has one of the most toxic gaming communities and now the player numbers are reducing too, lot of reasons like (fortnite) i did not say that name. But u know what, we have to become a better version of ourselves and don't blame valve for everything i know that they are not trying very hard but u know u and us together we can grow this community more. If u know ur friend is hacker UN-friend him off-course its your choice to do so and yeah reporting works too. And if u r a HACKER AND READING THIS then man!!! go and hack pubg and fortnite bruh!! those games are kind of open world and 99 people to kill im sure you'll have more fun or just play vice city type panzer and go berserk.  So, as to increase the community, please guys don't be toxic, if you play well do not think that everyone will play like you. People have problems like PC, internet or equipment issues. And yeah if you are determined to win then go to competitive MM with known people, create a team, i know it isn't easy but you'll find people. But please in case u want only to have fun or only to win then for god's sake don't play solo queue and ruin other people experience. If you r solo queuing than try to adapt to the team. And as a solo queue person you should be able to do it. And most important don't get angry on new people just try to give them directions not everyone who play csgo want to go pro most of the community people want to have a good time with friends and win. And about recommending the game, I highly recommend it. And, if anyone from valve reading this please remove the 7-day trading ban, make it 2-day. Keep hitting the M1 Gamerzzzzzzz, i'll be back with another review. -Shant_X out","2,377.6",Recommended,"142 people found this review helpful

730,2023-10-05 00:00:00,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories",47.8,Recommended,"65 people found this review helpful

730,2023-11-26 00:00:00,"Product received for free  As someone who has been playing counter-strike since 2001, I can say this is the worst version yet. Between massive registration errors, terrible graphics that make it feel more for kids, awful lighting affects, the amount of broken spray and pray laser beams even while people are running, taking away the ability to see damage in console(was extremely helpful in cs:go). As well as taking away other game modes IE gun game. I'm trying to force myself to like this version but just simply can't. The only neat feature they added was the dynamic smokes. All in in all a joke of a game. Also I would really like to thank valve for taking away cs:go from everyone's library ESPECIALLY those of who payed for the game and no longer have access.","7,356.6",Not Recommended,"326 people found this review helpful

730,2017-04-21 00:00:00,"4/10  Great game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall.  Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't.  ""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?  Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.  I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...  Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.  For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.  For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.  TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues. Use your wallet as your voice, stop buying Valve related products (including your favorite skins) until our concerns and issues are addressed and fixed.","3,132.2",Not Recommended,"449 people found this review helpful

730,2018-12-06 00:00:00,"I have played this game for years and years. Ever since I first layed my hands on it I loved it, and have never stopped loving it... untill today.  The biggest problem in CS:GO history was its hackers, and by making it free to play (and upgrading every person to prime status?!) they're opening the floodgates to a sh!tshow of hackers.  Who asked for battle royale mode? I didn't. Why did I get a stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ badge to show people I'm one of the idiots who purchased the game a long time ago? Why not spend time fixing issues and making the game better instead of this sh!t?  The first and final experience I had in ""Danger Zone"" was that some guy killed me because he had more luck finding good weapons than I did. Not his skill, not my lack of skill, but luck decided the outcome of our shootout, as is the case with all battle royale games. This is not what CS:GO was ever about and I despise valve's decision to make it so.  Don't download this, unless you like games like fortnite, in which case: why aren't you just playing fortnite?  The last decent competitive fps has fallen.  ps. I want a refund. I didn't pay 20 euro for CS:GO to become this horrid adaptation of the characterless battle-royale that's free-to-play and consequently free-to-hack.","1,939.5",Not Recommended,"315 people found this review helpful

730,2021-04-15 00:00:00,"CS:GO is a tactical shooter game that has been around for several years now, and it has continued to gain popularity over time. The game is set up in a way that players take turns playing as terrorists or counter-terrorists in a series of rounds. The objective of the terrorists is to plant a bomb while the counter-terrorists try to prevent them from doing so.  One of the reasons why CS:GO has become so popular is because of its highly competitive gameplay. The game requires players to have good teamwork, strategy, and communication skills to win. There are also various weapons and equipment available to players, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages.  Another reason why CS:GO is such a popular game is because of its highly engaging and addictive gameplay. The game requires a lot of skill and practice to master, which means that players are always looking to improve and get better. This makes the game highly replayable, as there is always something new to learn and new challenges to overcome.  In terms of graphics and audio, CS:GO may not be the most visually stunning game out there, but it does have its own unique style and charm. The audio effects in the game are also well-designed and add to the overall immersion of the game.  The graphics in CS:GO with next upgrade to Counter-Strike 2 are impressive, with detailed textures and realistic environments that help to immerse you in the game. The sound design is also excellent, with realistic weapon sounds and environmental effects that add to the overall atmosphere.  Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fantastic tactical shooter that is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the game, there's something here for everyone. If you're looking for an adrenaline-fueled multiplayer experience, CS:GO is the game for you.","6,131.5",Recommended,31 people found this review helpful 0

730,2016-11-12 00:00:00,"Main Review  This review is carefully worded explanation on my 'departure' from CS:GO and why in its current state, I would not recommend the game. This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all.  So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top.  So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc.  The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though.  Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes.  In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up.  Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game.  TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.   In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly.","2,061.9",Not Recommended,"1,438 people found this review helpful

730,2019-08-17 00:00:00,"Update: The lack of cheaters recently has been promising.  While cheats and hackers were historically a problem for this game, it is now completely out of control. Hacks have become so common and evolved that any player could be using them, even crap players. VAC bans are very common, but brand new accounts are more common. I have 20 years experience with Counter Strike.  Shame on Valve. You could do so much better, but instead you do what makes you money. You always have, you always will. Until Valve decide to fix broken game that they still sell (yes they sell status upgrades and in-game items), avoid the entire company in anyway you can, let alone just this game.  Update: cheating is even worse, with many people just openly admitting it. Game is dead and handed over to cheats.","5,770.5",Not Recommended,"221 people found this review helpful

730,2024-07-18 00:00:00,"It's completely filled to the brim with cheaters.  Update 1/21/25: - Unskilled players are now using DMA (Direct Memory Access) PCI Cards to cheat - Combined with a second PC - a DMA card slotted in PC A sends realtime memory to PC B which can then be read/analyzed/acted upon - PC B can simply read the memory on PC A, and can send realtime undetectable ESP onto PC A when combined with a display fuser - DMA Card when also combined with a M&K Controller (""KMBox""), PC B can send realtime inputs (Aimbot, Triggerbot, etc) to PC A - DMA Card can be repeatedly flashed with new firmware making detection near impossible - There is an entire black market for undetectable firmware - Valve doing nothing about these DMA Cards on top of not even issuing a statement shows they simply do not care about the ""elite competitive experience"" - Valve will take action against legitimate players finding a loophole in the Armory Pass, and in a few hours - but will not take any concrete action against players abusing the entire game (hacking) and for years  - VAC is the worst anti-cheat in existence. Valve takes HWID of users however, they will not ban based on HWID. They only ban by account so the hacker can just make a new one and do it all over again. - Valve is making a huge profit off NOT banning hackers. When a hacker gets their account banned, they just get another one and purchase prime ($15). Valve clearly sees this as a revenue source and will never actually take any real action against cheaters. - There is a secondary market for leveling fresh accounts to premiere and selling them, people use inexpensive hacks to level accounts and then re-sell them for more - People are running automated AI-based bots that can dupe weapons and automatically cheat same as in TF2 - Premiere game mode is completely off balance. Once you reach 10k+ ELO your matches will only net you ~50-100 ELO and you will lose between ~300-1000 every game. Complete timesink. - Valve's ""subtick"" is garbage. The game will always have peeker's advantage - if you have a high ping around around 50ms-100ms you will always have that much more time to see someone on your screen before they will see you - Public ""find a group"" feature is filled with Russians posing as ""professional"" players who invite you to lobbies, try to get you into a discord channel and then socially engineer you to ""signup for their team"" which is a steam account phishing page.  Game is still fun and a classic - but is clearly still in an alpha development stage. Valve trying to claim or boast that CS2 is a ""competitive"" shooter is completely invalid. Any ""competitive"" teams are phony. Faceit, ESEA and competitive game modes all filled with blatant cheaters. You could dump years of time into this game trying to ""git gud"" but you will never beat the script kiddies let alone be able to keep up with the constant updates to the game mechanics.  I highly encourage everyone to play this game on competitive/premiere mode and treat it as if completely casual, because it is.","2,235.7",Not Recommended,"101 people found this review helpful

730,2017-10-19 00:00:00,"CS:GO, I mean the game itself is very fun but there is a huge issue that makes the experience so terrible. Once you reach a decently high rank in matchmaking that is Legendary Eagle Master and above, 60% of the games you will proceed to play will be against cheaters. These cheaters use paid cheats of at least ($40USD) per month; and they bypass overwatch by closet cheating, which means they hide their cheats by trying to look legit. This allows them to bypass overwatch as they hide their cheats quite well and make their shots look as if it was all luck. I myself have been queued against cheaters 8 games in a row in LEM-GE matchmaking. Because of stuff like this I've started moving onto other games such as Overwatch (the game from Blizzard). I actually enjoy CS:GO more than Overwatch but the game is filled with cheaters in the higher matchmaking ranks that ruins the experience for people like myself. The situation is actually disgusting, where we now have people who queue with cheaters in order to gain a high rank, because at this point if you want to reach and maintain GE you either queue with cheaters or become one; at least in the Oceania scene of matchmaking. And I forgot to mention that this is in Prime matchmaking, which is supposed to be fairly safe. These cheaters also have groups where they admit to cheating, even inviting more people to join them and play matchmaking while they either boost them or cheat together. CS:GO as a game is great, but I really hope Valve puts a hold on adding new skins all the time and actually makes a decent anti-cheat which bans all those external software users. Many people suggest ESEA, but there are people like me who have no interest of going pro or playing at tournaments in the future, ESEA is for people who are serious and dedicated to the game; for those who are looking to be a step ahead. I'm just a normal player who enjoys the game, I'm not looking to go big in CS, so I do not see why someone like myself would need to pay to play a legit game of ranked CS:GO. What's funny is a third party matchmaking client has a better anti-cheat than a multi-millionaire company like Valve. The VAC waves of one cheat are not enough. There are many other cheats out there and new ones are made all the time. I really like this game but at this point I feel like quitting due to stuff like this. This is why for now I won't recommend this game; not unless Valve at least manages to actually fix this issue.","1,289.6",Not Recommended,"537 people found this review helpful

730,2016-02-17 00:00:00,"Want a real and honest review? Here you go:  Used to be one of the best FPS games out there. At this point the game is so broken and badly maintained. Dev's don't listen to the players and just do things to the game nobody wanted.  What players asked: New missions and 128-tick servers. What do we get? We get some nice updates of never wanted gloves with free game breaking addons. Oh how about we give you a nice new sound system nobody wanted just because we can.  Let's talk about the VAC system (Valve Anti Cheat): Probally one of the worst working anti cheat systems out there. People can go spinbotting / wallhacking ingame without insta triggering red flags, no they just get a some people in overwatch after 10 reports looking at it. Instead of building a better VAC system to help keep the game fun and fair, they give us gloves and game breaking addons. But I guess if they made the VAC system better half of the pro's out there get insta banned and then it's bye bye CS:GO.  Soon 1.000 hours for me, never had a higher then 0.03€ skin drop, a friend of mine played, gets a 250€ M4A1-S drop with his first deathmatch... It's random but maybe recode it so things like this don't happen because it absolut BS.  But after all, I enjoy the game even tho 1/3 games gives a hacker and 1/2 games give a high chance of dropping you in a game full of russians.  VALVE, fix your game like the PEOPLE want it: - 128-tick servers - Better VAC system, even tho half the pro's gets banned - Fix bugs in the game / maps instead of adding gloves just to get more money - Different servers for RU / EU with no way to mix those together - Fix those damn hitboxes - Add that's it recommended to have a microphone and have some basic English knowledge.  Game: 8/10 Good game in general, could use some better hitboxes Maps: 7/10 Some maps just have so low FPS for people it's unplayable Dev's: 5/10 Give a lot broken updates but fixes them more or less within 2 weeks Servers: 6/10 Some Valve servers are laggy and they should be split between RU / EU / Asia / US  Total: 6.5/10  Would I buy it again?: To play a broken game with russians?

730,2023-11-05 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike 2 has been rushed into live compounded by the moronic decision to replace CSGO completely instead of being it's own game.  CS2's implementation of the networking system, ""Subtick"", is god ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful and in my opinion is vastly inferior to CSGO. I have never felt like I have no idea where my bullets are going until CS2. I can be dead on some one with my crosshairs, steady stance, unload a mag in precise bursts and the server reports zero hits. There have been plenty of clear blatant examples of poor hit rig with people shooting point blank on someone not moving and still missing, just watching the bullets go right through them.  The aggravating meme of Ferrari peeks is ridiculous and there is no humanly way to fight someone that either doesn't appear on your screen until you are already dead, getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by ghosts seemingly or seeing them for a fraction of a second giving the same outcome.  Playing against teams that just rush with P90's is like getting brutally ass ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by a rusty, unlubed, bad dragon dildo without consent or courtesy to spit first which you are powerless to stop...unless you stop playing. It's even worse with peekers advantage being so bad that if you are even a semi-decent shot, someone with an AK-47 will be hitting your power off button more times than a retarded monkey in an IT shop.  Lets not get started on the fact that what replaced a playable CSGO on all spectrum's (network and performance) has been replaced with a very poorly optimised mess that requires a top-end PC to have even semi-decent FPS. While with CSGO you could have a relatively low-end system and still play at reasonable FPS - now this eldritch monstrosity will sap every ounce of power from your rig and cry out for more.  Change your beta branch to CSGO and wait a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long time to play this garbage. Infuriating is the kindest way you could call the CS2 experience.","1,028.2",Not Recommended,"532 people found this review helpful

Premier, Competetive, High Trust Factor, Low Trust Factor, Prime, Not Prime. You are likely to encounter someone using hacks in AT LEAST 1 in 2 games, if you're lucky.

730,2016-12-23 00:00:00,"Seems like Valve has completely forgotten about this game. After 2.5k hours + I can honestly say it is one of the best games I have ever played. However, now I'm at the top end of the game, you struggle to find a legit game where there isn't any cheaters. You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).  Keep adding Stat-Trak music kits and gloves to a 64-tick broken game Valve.","15,158.5",Not Recommended,"712 people found this review helpful

Differenced in gameplay: You want to secure something from beeinng blown up or blew it up. Alternative you have to secure hostages or stop the SWAT securering them.    Easy to learn but hard to master. Forget about running with an Assault Rifle and give headshots to everyone like in other FPS. For this you have to choose the P-90. No seriously it took some time to know how to control the spray of your weapons.  Just pressing the fire button is not enough here. CS is still one of the most skill and game-sense required games.  To help you mastering this you can download and play training maps from the workshop. (Smokes,Flashes,Recoil,Aim)    Difficult!

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

730,2017-12-13 00:00:00,"Rating: good (7/10)  Introduction Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a First Person Shooter set in a comptetetive scene where two teams battle for an objective. It is a stand-alone follow-up to the famous Counter-Strike mod from Half-Life where terrorists battle the Counter-Terrorists on different locations.  Gameplay & Story: 6/10 The gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents. Easier said than done actually, since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some AI programmed to shoot you first. CS:GO is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years, since it offers great weapon balance, tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day. The story behind the game is based on the oldschool Counter-Strike game, where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being Counter-Terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at Terrorist base.   The combat is absolutely fluid in CS:GO and there are barely any moments, that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying. People tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps, weapons or programming of the game, however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market. The challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches, playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french. I am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if I did not win the match no matter the team stacks. Reaching Global Elite rank after around 200 hours, I can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you.   The graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good, sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better, that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters. Most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable, like certain grapphiti on some maps. The interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration.   It is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing CS:GO in any form, there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell. Some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market, so different ways to progress in and outside of the game. The biggest progress for me was improving my hand-to-eye coordination by playing it competetively.   Each weapon sound is unique for itself, and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from. CS:GO fulfills its task really well. The music is played only in menues and during the highlights. The game music is nothing special, but since you can get/buy music kits to fit your music taste, Valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves.        CS:GO has its reasons to be the Number One FPS in the ESL Scene and its popularity is currently only rising. It is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state, but still keeps getting updated. I would recommend trying CS:GO to every game, just to know what this game is that defines the global FPS market so much and while FPS fans might love it, some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna-bes.   I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game.

730,2020-04-14 00:00:00,"This game will ruin any ambitions you have in real life. This game will consume all your energy, money and happiness. You might start as a casual player, enjoying the fun parts of the game. But the more you play, the more you descend into this pit of pure mental torture. This game will make even the most calm person into a raging toxic human being in some point of playing. The sheer toxicity this game causes even suppasses neurosis of the traditional road rage. You're better off hot railing meth than playing this godforsaken game. For every moment of fun and accomplishment you get 5 moments of desperation in this addicting hell hole.  Now when it comes to skins. The marketing and hype for skins is absolutely incredible. Valve did a good job creating a platform, where having expensive items that do jack'all is considered that of a higher social status, somehow similar to buying expensive branded clothes. Of course a lot of people don't care about skins. But let me tell you. Once you start getting into the game more. You start seeing yourself improving as you go on. And you will absolutely spend money on skins rather than buying a new game or something different on steam. It's an ego trap. Everyone thinks they are on a road to becoming the best player, which gives them a justification for spending money on useless ♥♥♥♥, and for the more mentaly unstable individuals... Gamble with those items, so that they get stuck in this loop of wanting to return to their base value by gambling more. Creating gambling addicts disguised as videogame players- What is even more damaging, is the fact that valve doesn't enforce the ratings of their games, even to the extent of microtransactions. Making teenagers without developed rational thinking fall down the rabbit hole on the same basis as non-consentable sexual conduct would have.  2/10","4,868.1",Not Recommended,"878 people found this review helpful

One of the aspects that made CS:GO an was its exceptionally smooth performance and precise gunplay. Unfortunately, Counter-Strike 2 falls short in this department. The game doesn't run nearly as smooth, and the gunplay lacks the precision that I cherished in CS:GO. It's a noticeable step backward for a series known for its meticulous attention to gun mechanics.  What really saddens me is Valve releasing CS2 as CS:GO's replacement instead of releasing as its own title. Many of us built communities and friendships through countless hours of competitive matches and casual games on CS:GO. The decision to fully replace CS:GO means that these cherished experiences are no longer accessible, leaving a void in the heart of this long-time player.  While Counter-Strike 2 attempts to introduce new elements and modernize, it doesn't quite capture the essence of what made CS:GO special. The adjustments have altered the game's core identity, leaving veteran players like myself feeling disconnected from the franchise we once loved.","2,592.6",Not Recommended,"87 people found this review helpful

730,2024-04-01 00:00:00,"Title: A Disheartened Player's Goodbye to Counter Strike 2  As someone who's been playing Counter Strike since 1.6, I've spent countless hours immersed in its gameplay. But now, it's time to say goodbye to Counter Strike 2. The reason? Cheaters and toxic players have taken over, ruining the experience for everyone else.  I've seen the game's integrity decline over time. Cheaters run rampant, and toxic behavior, especially from certain regions, has become the norm. Matches are often ruined by hackers or players who kick others or grief just for fun.  Despite my love for Counter Strike, I can't ignore these issues. It's disappointing to see the developers focus on superficial additions like new skins instead of tackling the game's core problems. Features like ""dynamic smoke"" feel like distractions from the real issues.  So, I've uninstalled Counter Strike 2. It's tough to let go of a game I used to enjoy so much, but I can't keep subjecting myself to this toxic environment. Maybe if the developers start taking cheating and toxicity seriously, I'll come back. Until then, it's goodbye to a game that used to bring me joy.","1,000.0",Not Recommended,"61 people found this review helpful

730,2017-08-22 00:00:00,"After my 2000 hours put into this game. I have come to the conclusion this game became a money pit that will never care about the people who play it. Which is why it is filled with hackers, griefers, bad servers, toxic people like the 12 year olds who get their moms card and buy it and a knife feeding the money addiction of valve. If maybe for once they listened to the community this game wouldn't be a sack of ♥♥♥♥. Will this make me quit? No, because i want this game to be good but it wont be, EVER. So if youre thinking about buying it, please do not, save your money buy something worth your money like PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS which is killing every game out their. Look what happened to Shroud he quit Cloud9 to stream BATTLEGROUNDS and go further with his streaming career if you think you will be good enough to be pro, youre wrong you will never get there with the state of this game. Hitboxes are trash. Tick servers are bad. The community is garbage. The only way to play this game anymore is with a third-party service like ESEA because the people there really care about this game, and they know how to use good servers with 128 ticks. The only way this game with continue to live will be if they actually change things with it, But with valva that wont happen it took over a year for a new operation and only ever add cases causing people to waste their money on the rigged case system because they wont show their odds but ban the case sites that show the odds of the items that can be won. Yes there were scandals in the past but now people are more cautious and because of that valve is exploiting the people by making them buy their cases without giving the odds of them. This game is only there for people to spend money and make valve richer. They glove skins really? Is that a good idea valve giving people gloves. No. Stop making this game a money pit and actually do something to make this gmae playable otherwise it is dead as well as the professional scene.  why am i still playing this game.","2,492.0",Not Recommended,"1,170 people found this review helpful

730,2014-10-16 00:00:00,"Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.  Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.  With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.  I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.  The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.  I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.  And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.  But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.  All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.",403.0,Recommended,"103 people found this review helpful

I first heard about Counter Strike after I found out about The Orange Box on my X-box console which led me to finding out about Counter Strike Source which I later got to experience on my buds PC. This led me to creating a steam account. I really enjoyed CSS and even got into a group of experienced players. Every weekend we would all get together with other semi competitive groups to play against each other. Fast forward a decade after lots of health issues and family problems I started getting back into video games and come to find out about Counter Strike Global Offensive. Seeing the new and improved versions of the maps and bombsites we used to spar for really kick-started my interest in playing again. Fast forward I bought myself a powerful computer and created a new account after spending weeks trying to recollect my old login in my now not so sharp brain.

If you love friendly interactions from all sorts of Ethnicities then this is your game. Pros 1. You can slowly get the money you paid for the game back with 1p drops in game 2. If your rich you can show all the peasants how cool your knives look and make all the Russian children trade in their grain stores to buy a sand dune nova. 3. Kill Terrorist ( big thumbs up from American players) 4. A deep and engrossing story line and ranking system with so much context into the terrorists motivations.  Cons 1.Terrorists are evil and no one tells me why, the game should be more politically correct or call them freedom, fighters. 2. Game is old and I cant kill ISIS, may change in the future if valve wants to make this game an immersive experience. 3. Lots of children with horrible voices that make you want to use a cheese grater on your skull. 4. If you have friends you wont have them long as you will rage every time they let you die leading to you pouring piping hot tea on your sisters face. 5. All developed nations decide to allow their troops to go to battle without body Armour making them spend their salary on equipment - 40000 immersion points. 6. If you are British there is a whole wealth of opportunities to hear constant slaughtering of your language and a barrage of Tea hate which will be most disturbing.

730,2023-10-24 00:00:00,"## 2025 Update ##  Most of what I was ranting about has been resolved :) Cheaters are still present (I would guess 1 in 10 games) but not completely ruining the game. Comp queue is slightly better and the ranks are only a little annoying. Servers feel MUCH BETTER, although some of my friends have jitter issues, but we are in different time zones. Lag will always happen in online games so its whatever. They still need to add more content but the work they did on the map Train is honestly magnificent. I think its safe to come back to CS2 now :)  ## 2023 Review Below ##  CS:GO was by far my most played game. I really enjoyed the feel of the game and while it was clear that it had become outdated, valve has managed to make COUNTLESS mistakes with the switch to CS2.  My biggest gripe is servers. I have 1000+ hrs in this game. I can FEEL in my BONES when an awp shot hits. I would say anywhere from 10% to 30% of the shots I take should have hit but magically do not. It is clearly a server side issue because I have reviewed my gameplay clips and I would say only 1 in 10 of them were situations where I actually missed. The server just decided that the other players inputs were more important for some reason. Upgrade the servers. Stop trying your little tricky 'but im not like other 64 tick servers' and actually upgrade to 128.  Second gripe. Cheaters. How. HOW!!??! are there so many cheaters already. This game has been out for a gosh dang MONTH and every fourth game has a blatant cheater. VAC doesn't work and it hasn't since 2015. You clearly did not prioritize how players would feel while playing while making this redesign. All you focused on was flashy new lighting effects that nobody cares about besides the 10000 people that happen to own doppler knives. Your priorities are completely wrong.  Third gripe. Matchmaking sucks. Individual player performance should be taken into account, not just win or loose. You ripped everything else off of valorant why not rip this off of them as well.  Fourth gripe. 4-queue is gone. I play almost exclusively with 3 other friends. We now have to find a rando in 'looking to play' which is fine aside from the fact that it is the exact same scenario we would be in as if we queued with 4 players in GO and got matched with a rando. It didn't change anything, especially because its not like there's a separate queue for 5 stacks likes there is in valorant. So what exactly did the lock of 4-queue achieve???  Fifth gripe. CSGO should have still remained playable. I have friends with computers that cant run CS2 and now I cant play with them.  Sixth gripe. Zero new content. This is all the way down here at the bottom because it is by far the least important of the items on this list, but if you're going to pretend you're releasing a shiny new game, it would help to have something to be excited about, like maybe a new case of skins that look amazing using the new engine you wanted to show off, or maybe a new map for people to learn instead of just porting half of the CSGO maps over. The game is brand new and already feels more stale than CSGO ever did.  I really do love the CS franchise, and I really want to see it succeed, but you are loosing players at an alarming rate because of the big issues I listed above. I would suggest the Valve team start by addressing the game feel and server issues because I know I am not alone in feeling this way. This should be something you can fix in the next month. From there you should look to completely overhaul your anti-cheat system. This could take a year to complete but it is so important to the players who feel like they cant improve or climb because of the sheer number of cheaters. After that you should probably focus on designing and implementing seriously sick maps and skins. The community needs something to be excited about, and something that shows off the hard work you have already done to improve the game. Additionally, we need community servers back. the CS community is what gives CS its life and the only reason why it has been able to maintain a playerbase in the face of newer competitors like valorant. Surf, trade, scouts n knives servers, these are the lifeblood of the CS community.  Finally, expand. This game has been the same for too long. Its time to add drastically different game modes (like danger zone), new guns, and any new content that could be fun, silly, or interesting. This is where valve's creativity as a game developer can really run wild.  I pass along to you the sentiment of your players. We want you to succeed so we can continue to experience and enjoy the game we have come to love so dearly, but seeing the state it is in right now, it is hard to stay excited. So this is your opportunity to listen to your die-hard community while they're still here. These things need to change or you will lose your title to competitors, and CS2 will just be an embarrassing final chapter on an otherwise beloved story.","1,322.7",Recommended,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 14
730,2015-01-14 00:00:00,"I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.  Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.  Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?  CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.  If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.  Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)  EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.  ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.  Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.  At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches.  @Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply.  Cheers fellow comrades.","1,822.0",Not Recommended,"1,655 people found this review helpful

730,2019-03-27 00:00:00,"Tl;dr - fun and a competitive game. Has it's toxic side just like any other multiplayer game. 8/10 would recommend it. This game is the epitome of reflex. I love this game because it's simple yet the most complex of strategies can be implied. It doesn't just test your mechanical skill but also makes you really put in a mental effort. Really fun in a competitive 5 man lobby.  Pros:         Cons-      Hope Valve does something about the servers and add more features to this game instead of funding some ♥♥♥♥ p2w garbage like ARTIFACT that nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about.  -Tips for new players: 1. Get some friends to play with to begin with. More known players more the merrier. 2. You can completely customise how the games looks for you. Crosshair, viewmodel etc can be adjusted for your convenience. Make use of it. 3. Watch videos. 4. Indians/Pinoys on your team or general mic cancer teammates? Type enable_voice 0 in console.. you're welcome.  Conclusion: It's a fun game if you've a taste for competitiveness. Lower skill curve yet hard to master. 8/10 would recommend it. My first review and it's long as ♥♥♥♥ I don't think most of you would read it- but for those who have regardless of whether you relate to my review or not, thank you for spending time on this.

730,2017-02-06 00:00:00,"Product received for free  New Update for CS2:  It's even worse than I remember.  After being spoiled with a bunch of high end tick servers (128), going back to regular CS2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horrible. How Valve is getting away with the absolute trash state of the game is lost to me.  There are now, more so than ever... Bullets that hit, do no damage despite the blood on the wall behind them.  I have never seen such horrible server response except from when New World launched.  The recoil is absolutely awful and head shots are now more random than ever.  The VAC Anti-cheat is STILL non existent and Valve should be absolutely ashamed for ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ but their boxes bring in $$$$ so they don't care.  Valve just doesn't give a damn about CS anymore. Once their numbers were below a certain threshold, they released CS2: Dumpster Fire so that people would start buying boxes/keys again.  If you're thinking about hitting up CS2, don't. If I would of known how bad things would of gotten, I wouldn't of invested time into CS2 and now I got investors guilt so I keep playing.   CSGO/2 used to be fun. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I can both say yes and no to recommend this game.  Counter-Strike, can be good with friends but if you try to play a lot of random games to climb the ranks you will encounter the second most toxic gaming community ever. You get every kind of stereotype on here from the kid who slept with your mother to some guy calling everyone a b*tch N*gga.  With well over 2000 hours I can not recommend CS2 in its current condition. Why is that?  -Servers. The servers are horrible. 64 tick is not enough to play on. You will often encounter bullets that do no damage yet there is blood on the walls behind them. Their performance is lack luster and lots of servers are doing a stutter/stop as of lately or the registration is just... Non-existant.  -Hackers. They are still running rampant in CS2. ""Prime"" accounts are still subject to them. It seems as if VAC is not working at all. You will encounter a LOT of them from Silver to MGE. (There are smurfs but you can tell them apart from hackers very easily. I enjoy playing smurfs as I see it as a chance to see what I need to work on to get better.)  -Toxic community. This game relies on three very major things. 1. Aim 2. Communication 3. Listening. There are very seldom times that you will come across a team that is willing to Communicate and Listen. From my experience (MGE or lower for the majority) A lot of people do not communicate because they are talking too much and when you ask them to hush for the rest of the game and to type, they throw hissy fits as if their mother just denied them a cookie. If you try to communicate with people and call stuff, and they blame you for their death becuase you're trying to communicate where the enemies are. ""One B"" - Teammate dies - ""OMG WHY DID YOU SAY HE WAS B WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE A!"" Everyone ALWAYS tries to blame others instead of understanding that it was just good timing on their end.  -Gambling addictions with opening cases. Opening cases can be fun at times. However, the absolutely horrible prices for keys makes it a very expensive risk if you get a simple item that is only worth $0.02 on the CM. A lot of people waste their money here.   NOW FOR THE GOOD  -Meeting awesome new people. I have met quite a few people on here. Some of the best people I have ever had the chance to encounter. It was awesome! We still enjoy kicking back and having a few beers.  -Gaming Tournaments. TONS of LAN parties play CS2 or CS1.6 and it's an absolute amazing time. Everyone gets super serious but also come out of it with smiles, win or lose.  -Hand + Eye coordination improvement. My hand and eye coordination used to be utterly horrible. However, MAAAAAAAANY years ago, when I first got CS1.5 my hand and eye coordination improved drastically over the time.   Would I recommend this game? Yes and no  Yes - Having fun with friends is great! No - Everything stated that was bad. And it grows the more and more you play.","2,847.7",Not Recommended,"128 people found this review helpful

730,2017-02-20 00:00:00,"Let me preface this just a bit.  I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual.  So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad, ♥♥♥♥, etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun.  However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely piss poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all.  The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat.  Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad.  Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy ass community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game.  Tks for reading. -Sen",600.8,Not Recommended,"436 people found this review helpful

730,2017-08-30 00:00:00,"Product received for free  After playing the game for roughly 500 hours, I have come to a point that I should express my opinion about the game's current state.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a highly competitive game that focuses on team wo--. Really? You REALLY think im going to describe this game as the perfect cut gem of an E-Sports title?.... well, you came to the wrong review comrade!  In essence, CS:GO in its current state has some things you really wouldn't want in a game of this type:  -Cheaters/VAC: Most of them obviously have been cheating for a long time, but what does valve care? The only thing useful they do is milk their games for money until they are bone dry and deserted. I just can't get over that fact that valve hasn't actually ""noticed"" that their anti-cheat has flaws, but instead they keep releasing more useless items than bug fixing updates for the game itself.  -Griefers: They are not really common nowadays, but back in the day every 5/10 - 6/10 competitive matches i went would have atleast 1 griefer that didn't do anything but insult,generally discriminate or just flat-out do absolutely nothing to help the team win a single round. These individuals are most commonly found on the lower ranks, from my experience.  -SMURFS: I have seen more smurfs in cs:go matchmaking than in the actual cartoon itself.  Basically this ruins the game for new players by giving them the appearance that CS:GO just isn't worth playing if you don't know how.  -THE SALTENING BEGINS: Do you want to experience more highly concentrated amounts of salt in one match than in a salt mine, followed by a community of 12 year olds more cancerous than the radiation levels at Chernobyl? Well my friend, CS:GO is the game for you! (Warranty for broken mice, keyboards, screens, headsets, desks, windows, and possibly hands from hitting your desk too hard not included.)  -Servers: When I mean servers I don't intend to talk about the ping/lag, but instead about how most of the time I get matched against/with people from the other side of the damn galaxy. (This is good if you want to learn how everyone has had sexual intercourse with your family members/pets in diverse languages, while you simultaneously proceed to lose the match.)  TL;DR: CS:GO is a game that gives everybody a different experience (Unless you are playing in russia, then it's always B rushed every round).

730,2016-11-14 00:00:00,I feel really bad writing this review :( The game itself is just awesome...9/10 (no joke this game is nearly perfect) BUT there's a very big problem that makes me not recommend this game for y'all There are just TOO MANY cheaters...TOO MANY Russian and Turkish raging 10 year old kids...TOO MANY toxic players who try to tell you what to do all the time and they can't play for ♥♥♥♥ ... Overall the biggest problem of this great game is the community which completely ruins it and makes it nearly unplayable Just go and see how people talk and play in games such as rainbow6 or insurgency and you'll get what i mean... UPDATE : What I found very interesting about CSGO's reviews is 40-60% of the positive reviews are just telling the problems of the game and cons so... yeah:| UPDATE 2 : I completely forgot about hit registration in this game... Its pretty f...ed up too... You shoot a player right in the face with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWP and nothing happens then you get 1tapped instantly and your just sitting there wondering who you should swear at... (so yeah 1more reason not to buy this game...) UPDATE 3 : you're (tnx JNB),"1,382.1",Not Recommended,"687 people found this review helpful

Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie  Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.","4,161.7",Recommended,"492 people found this review helpful

730,2013-12-20 00:00:00,"Really good game. Very simple, yet complex at the same time. For first time players: DO NOT let the game's recoil mechanics scare you away. It will take some time to get used to but once you do, it is a great game.  PROS: [+] -Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES) -Frequent updates -Tradable stuff -Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics. -VERY Competitive at higher levels -Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps -Weapon skins -Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more -High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization)  CONS: [-] -Skins can be expensive or worthless -Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it -Recoil is not very easy to get used to -No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS) -Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly -Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN) -MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION) -Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels -Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginners  OVERALL: Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots.

730,2014-08-12 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check! Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.","30,457.2",Recommended,"43 people found this review helpful

730,2015-10-10 00:00:00,"Pros: -It's a huge e-sport  -very well done maps  -it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve.  -It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick up  The game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed.  Cons: -Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems.  -Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor. 128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.  -The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game.  -Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?  -There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)  -The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players.  Conclusion: The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around.  If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.  I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.  The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly.  All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.  But you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned.","2,352.4",Not Recommended,"377 people found this review helpful

730,2020-04-16 00:00:00,"I would not recommend this game for those in the community who do not have company to play with. With that said, lets jump into the review.  (Comments are on as I would like to highlight the toxic potential of the community. Many are correct to disagree with my opinions based on their experiences and express those opinions appropriately, but others will seek to be vile on purpose, and these are the people I warn you of. Also check my profile comments because some children are too ashamed to comment on here and instead hide it on there. Lol!)  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the only games that I can say has cultivated a community attitude of toxicity and hate as the NORMAL accepted attitude. I do not speak for all players I encounter, as there are many great users out there, but this game has done something terribly wrong. I have accumulated a total of 4000 hours in this game across numerous accounts, played from near the highest ranks to the lowest (Legendary Eagle Master - Silver two), and played with high and low trust factor (A built in game-measure to try and match you with players who are positively and negatively affecting the community)  This review is to highlight what is expect game-to-game in a CO-OPERATIVE and TEAMWORK driven game for the average player, from my experiences and those of my friends and fellow strangers who share similar opinions. I will touch on different parts of the games failure to provide a positive and encouraging base for players to engage with the game-modes provided.  TRUST-FACTOR: Trust factor is essentially the games way of matching you with similarly minded individuals by including factors such as: Amount of reports received; Temporary cool-downs; Commendations; Reality: Trust factor is EXTREMELY ineffective at segregating those who wish to be verbally abusive, to the extreme of your default trust factor of a new account being unbearably vile. E.x: I had a new account and within the first four games, I had been kicked by two groups of ""4-queued"" friends for their amusement, encountered one aim-assisted user blatantly killing, and only one game having friendly users who also complained about the same repetitive toxicity. So at the base level, using hacks (program assistance to enhance personal game-play), intentional losing of games, verbal abuse, and harassment is the default level of the community.  OVERWATCH: Overwatch is a built in review system that users have access to after reaching the rank of Gold Nova in the competitive game-mode, giving them the option to review users games who have received multiple reports within a VERY short time. From my understanding and what I have heard, a user must be reported upwards of 10 TIMES in a single day for exploits. Problem is there are 9 other people in a given match the hacking individual is in. This means that if they are playing with friends, it would take NUMEROUS games for the individual to even make it to this preliminary review process. This means if all people do not report, it is a free pass to hack once to twice a day and have no repercussions. The conviction rate of hacking users in Overwatch is minimal. Here is a link to a Q&A about Overwatch, and with a skim over you should be able to see flaws in many places.  RANK SYSTEM: The point of a rank system is to separate people by average skill level and consistency of game-play. CS:GO is the WORST example of this. Disappointing is an understatement, with no regulation of users making new accounts to play in lower ranks, and the anti-cheat program being a joke of a program, any rank is any rank, and if you want to climb to higher ranks, best of luck. Silver, the lowest rank, is the most toxic, alternate account using, and hacking users makes it EXTREMELY hard and aggravating to achieve a sense of accomplishment within the progressive rank system. Gold Nova gets a little better, with users usually having climbed past the majority of idiotic venom of silver, and finding more like minded people. Master Guardian is the IDEAL rank to relax, and find the most common ground. Users often have played seriously for some time, and have been through the rough of the community. That being said, often people are very serious and wont tolerate room for ""fun"". Above this rank, Legendary Eagle and up, its a serious game for serious gamers. The good and bad comes with the territory of being more elite, attitudes and all.  Game-modes: DEATHMATCH: Good for chilling with music, the community can be toxic but I usually find matches quiet at times and enjoyable. Type Voice_enable 0 into console, this is a great command (this disables voice communications if you do not want random music, people yelling, racism, or toxicity for meaningless things)  Arms-Race: A typical gun-progression based game-mode, similar to death-match, just different game-play.  Hostage: Rescue a hostage and deliver them to the delivery zone while fighting off defending terrorists. No idea what the community is like because I avoid this game-mode completely! (If I had to guess, not too pleasant, but if it is message me NOW)  That covers just about all I want to about your expected experience of this teamwork and co-operative based game. Now a few comments about the GAME:  PROS: -difficult and rewarding gun-play that improves with practice and invested time -great game loop and feel of round-to-round game-play -depthful skill-development -can always improve and grow stronger as a player -dynamic maps with fairly balanced designs  CONS: -limited selection of guns(although hard to master what their is) -Few maps per gamemode, or reused -terrible community -often useless and few patches and updates -old game engine vulnerable to exploits -pretty terrible graphics considering modern titles comparable to CS:GO -non-optimized programming and map rendering leads to FPS drop and poor performance -Low-quality and poor running servers at times  *EDIT* I would like to extend an offer to anyone who feels like this review is true, and would like a non-toxic and welcoming community for gaming and CS:GO.

I had a lot of fun, but with the release of the glove update, I understood, that CS GO community and Valve no longer care about the players, and are just in there for the money.  In every game there is a 90% chance that you will either get a cheater or a smurf, and what does Valve and CS GO community do about it?? they release new cases.  Before this game used to be fun, and after a hard day, I would come and enjoy a few rounds with my friends, but now instead of fun I get stressed with all the cheaters.

You've made it easier for cheaters to access Prime matches; a paywall didn't stop them from buying the game before so why would a cheaper paywall to play Prime stop them now.  Oh and by the way, never make a paid game free to play if it still has a huge active community. All of those people didn't buy and support your game for you to make it free when players become less interested in it, it's just a huge slap in the face. It would've been perfect if you had released Danger Zone as a stand alone free-to-play title, keeping the paywall and Prime status sign up for CS:GO and work to further improve the both of them periodically... but no, so a thumbs down for you.",578.2,Not Recommended,"129 people found this review helpful

730,2016-12-25 00:00:00,"Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly seen in tablet form (ecstasy) and crystal form (molly or mandy), is a potent empathogen–entactogen with stimulant properties primarily used for recreational purposes.[ The desired effects include altered sensations, increased energy, empathy, and pleasure. When taken by mouth, effects begin in 30 to 45 minutes and last 3 to 6 hours.  MDMA was first developed in 1912 by Merck. It was used to enhance psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. It may be mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine.[17] In 2016, about 21 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.3% of the world population). ] This was broadly similar to the percentage of people who use cocaine or amphetamines, but lower than for cannabis or opioids. In the United States, as of 2017, about 7% of people have used MDMA at some point in their lives and 0.9% have used it in the last year.",599.0,Recommended,"No one has rated this review as helpful yet

730,2014-03-15 00:00:00,"Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.","2,616.3",Recommended,148 people found this review helpful 0

When I first encountered CSGO for the first time at a young age(im sad to say it was the roblox version) I instantly fell in love with it. I had played other shooters and this one was something different to me. It was fast paced, but balanced. It was not one of those games a brain dead person could excel at, it was perfection. I have played CSGO for 7 years now on different accounts and although it is always the same basic idea, every match I have played was different. CSGO is one of the few rare games I have played were I never get bored of it, I always find myself coming back to it. I have gone though weeks of terrible performance yet I still find pleasure in the game. CSGO is the game that never dies, because the community cannot let this game go. It is too perfect, the best FPS ever created. For those of you who are wondering wether to play this game or buying prime, you should do it.

Many maps (sad mostly servers play only Dust 2 & Mirage), the old good maps get really good new design even on less graphic qualities and mostly a new few ways, so old tactics dont work anymore because a new way brings danger from behind. The game has changed a bit and has new modes like destruction, that feel a bit like Call of Duty BO2 and arms race where you can/need show your skills with 20 different weapons, so you need to be a allstar with all weapons. What is a weak point on casual playing (to much AWP Sniper Laming like in CSS) and mostly not even restricted to 1 and the loud flaming kids are a 2nd problem, its not easy enough to mute them or to kick, but the game is tacticaly very good, sad i am not 21 years anymore, different leagues for different ages would be good, but for 13.99 or a 50 % discout is this game all money worth if you like Ego Shooters. Thx Valve i give this game for Ego Shooter Fans 97 % for others 86 % (because no story mode) and people that dont like Ego Shooters? Like always dont buy it. Thx for reading.  Add on: Valve let to much cheater play to long and ruin so the whole game and the laugh about it and the team mates kick there smartest and best gamer because he lose against lucker head shot voting and than you get time blockings because there are so many wannabe noobs kid that kick you because you make 1 failture, you dont do what this super pros says, because they fail and beeing bad losers.

730,2024-02-07 00:00:00,"So, after a year of subjecting myself to this game – and trust me, 'game' is a generous term – I've come to the conclusion that debating whether a group of koalas could do better is a legitimate argument. And forget about comparing it to classics like CS:GO; this game is like comparing a tricycle to a Ferrari.  Picture this: You're spraying bullets left, right, and center, missing every hit and suddenly, you've got a team full of Russians offering you extremely positive criticism. It's like being in a tutorial for 'How Not to Play.'  And the thrill of victory? Oh boy, it's a wild ride. Win a match, and you're rewarded with a whopping 100 elo points. Lose? Well, say goodbye to those points faster than you can say 'disconnect.'  Now, let's talk about the PC requirements. You could have a PC that costs more than a small country's GDP, and this game will still make it perform like it's powered by hamsters on a wheel. Lag? It's not a bug; it's a feature. Let`s focus on the positive:  The anti-cheat system – it's a masterpiece of nothingness! There's only a 7% chance you'll face off against someone who's downloaded every cheat code known to mankind. And those players with 600-1500 hours? They're like gaming gods, smiting 15-20.000 hour mere mortals with every click of their mouse.  So, if you enjoy subjecting yourself to digital torture, I highly recommend giving this game a try. It's like a bad relationship – toxic, frustrating, but somehow, you just can't quit.","13,981.2",Not Recommended,"52 people found this review helpful

730,2017-04-16 00:00:00,"Absolutely not recommendable because of the insane ammount of hackers.  Today i dropped From Global Elite to supreme and lost 3 games on SMFC against Rage Hacking kids. In one game we were 8:4 ahead and 1 opponent left, joined back 3 rounds later jsut to announce he quickly downloaded a hack. So after he ragecarried the remaining rounds getting 11 MVPs we obviously lost.  Don't get me wrong there are some strong players in this game who hit insane shots but with my almost 6 k hours of Counterstrike experience i can tell you that at least 5/7 matches have one hacker +, not even counting the insane amount of players using some kind of radar hack.  In fact Valve doesn't even care. Do they try getting rid of the Hacker Problem? No, not really. Instead they keep adding skins and cases you have to pay for. Overwatch function seemed nice in the early state, but watching an overwatch session, you can't hear the ingame voice chat, which pretty much makes it useless. How do you want to hear if some1 keeps playing music ingame, uses a microphone of 1937 or keeps flaming? Or a hacker calling ingame? No, all you can see is a Scoreboard and the PoV of the Suspect, of course you are not able to switch the teammates.  Counterstrike Anti-Cheat is so damn useless, a friend with 1 year programming experience was able to build a hack, which was undetected for over 2 years.  Another problem ist the community. Most players below LEM are queueing with 2+ mates only speaking their own explicit language. So why the hell is there no ""Team-Language"" Option ingame to fix these kind of things?  All in all CS-GO is a nice skill-based shooter with high potential, being ruined by a company only interested in milking the cow and a highly toxic community. To enjoy this game you would actually need to buy ESEA or just not play any kind of competative matches, which would make cs go kind of senseless.

Flawed ranking systems, peculiar and sinister teammates who are perpetually toxic, condescending or generally poorly behaved human beings. The updates occur once in a year, and there seems to be no interest whatsoever on Valve's part on the betterment of the product.  Matchmaking and competitive play has become a pain in the ass, where you have to hope for at least semi-decent teammates in order to have the slightest chance of winning a match. The ranking system makes no sense, where a person carrying and placing at the top of the scoreboard is punished and deranked because his team lacks skills and communicational efforts.","2,661.8",Not Recommended,"303 people found this review helpful

730,2014-12-14 00:00:00,"Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons.  Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games.  Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland.  Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo.  I've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter.","1,784.5",Recommended,"48 people found this review helpful

730,2021-12-11 00:00:00,"CS:GO review from a free account Counter-strike: Global Offensive is a game in which two teams (One Terrorist, and the other Counter Terrorist) try to prevail against the other. The Terrorists try to plant the bomb at one of two sites or wipe out the other team, and the Counter terrorists try to stop the terrorists from accomplishing their tasks.  Pros: Can be free to play (with limitations)- If you choose to play CS without upgrading your account, you can still play all of the game modes. It is actually pretty good for a free game. You cannot receive drops or a rank however. Steam cards are also not available to free accounts  Good multiplayer game- CS can be played with teams of 5 friends if you queue up in competitive mode. Cs also has the largest player base of any game on steam, so there are always people to play with.  Game is updated regularly- CS receives updates on the regular, and operations are added yearly (as of the date of this review)  Number of hackers lessened- In my experience, the number of hackers in this game has been greatly reduced over the years. I am playing on a new free to play account (an alt) to test this, and it does seem to hold up   hacking is still prevalent in csgo  The ranking system is hard to understand- You may lose a game and de-rank, then go on to win 5 games with no rank up. You need to be patient with the ELO system  There are not many gamemodes- To be fair, they have been updating cs and introduced things like short comp matches   Overall, csgo is a fun game, and if you dont care about getting a rank, a free to play account works well for your needs. I initially played casual for the first 2 years of my csgo gameplay (back in 2015). If you dont care about comp and ranks, this is essentially what a free account can offer you. You can get into games, and even play competitive mode these days without it being ranked. It is a fun game, and I do recommend it :)",4.4,Recommended,"112 people found this review helpful

730,2024-06-10 00:00:00,"CS2: Because You Clearly Needed More Salt in Your Life  Rating: 4.5/5 Face-Palms   I just spent the last 5 hours of my life playing CS2, and I'm still trying to figure out why I voluntarily subjected myself to this never-ending cycle of frustration and disappointment. It's like Valve took all the worst parts of online gaming, put them in a blender, and hit puree.  The gameplay is still solid, I'll give them that. It's like riding a bike – except the bike is on fire, and the road is made of broken dreams and shattered hopes. You'll still get that rush of adrenaline when you clutch up and win a round, but it's quickly replaced by the crushing despair of realizing you're still stuck in a lobby with a team of bots who think ""strategy"" is a fancy word for ""run around like a headless chicken and hope for the best.""  The graphics are nice, I guess. I mean, who doesn't love watching their opponents' avatars do the ""I just got killed by a 12-year-old with a sensitivity of 400"" dance? It's like Valve hired a team of expert animators to craft the perfect ""I'm about to rage-quit"" facial expressions.  And don't even get me started on the community. I'm pretty sure the only thing more toxic than the game's chat is the water in a Chernobyl cooling tower. It's like everyone's competing in some sort of twisted, masochistic game of ""Who Can Be the Most Creative with Their Insults."" I've seen more civil discourse at a Kanye West concert.  But hey, at least the sound design is on point. I mean, who doesn't love the soothing sound of their own screams of frustration echoing through their headphones at 3 AM?  In conclusion, CS2 is a game that will simultaneously make you want to pull your hair out and scream ""ONE MORE ROUND!"" until the wee hours of the morning. It's like a bad relationship – you know it's not good for you, but you just can't help yourself.  Pros:  Still a great game, I guess Will make you question your life choices Excellent training for developing a thick skin and a strong sense of humor  Cons:  Will make you want to throw your computer out the window May cause spontaneous combustion due to excessive rage Not recommended for people with high blood pressure or a weak heart  Recommendation:  If you enjoy punishing yourself with a never-ending cycle of frustration and disappointment, then CS2 is the game for you!

730,2014-06-27 00:00:00,"I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases. There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance. As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game. Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching Hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb Aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated If you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out: You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits. You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly. You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server) You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof. You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die. All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, ""Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions"" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, ""good"" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation. An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment. People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago? 3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind. This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable. It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.",519.4,Not Recommended,64 people found this review helpful 0

Ingredients:  1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie  Directions:  1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.","6,966.1",Recommended,"73 people found this review helpful

730,2024-06-21 00:00:00,"Game was extremely good during CSGO. The ability to run servers at 128 tick felt free and PLAYED BETTER THAN MATCHMAKING. Valve, in their infinite wisdom decided to create subtick but cap it to 64 so that the game produces a significantly worse rubber banding experience than 100ms servers even with low ping. I have more than 1000 hours in this game (produced mainly while playing CSGO) and have around 200ish at most hours of playing cs2. This change is absolutely trash, HE grenades blind you if someone peaks after it explodes since they can see through the dust cloud but you can't, the graphics are CRANKED up to 10 so you can't focus on things that are TRULY important because for some reason they're trying to make this a AAA game, gun fights/spraying feel TERRIBLE due to subtick being trash, peaker's delight (if you're terrible and just like to run and gun you will most likely be rewarded), and the anti-cheat doesn't do its job half of the time making wall hackers RAMPANT. Additionally, I cannot get over the fact that a PLETHORA of lvl 0 or 1 accounts with 60 hours are PUMPING ME LIKE I AM ON ORANGE YOUTUBE and competitive is now a JOKE. I can't do it anymore, as a community we need to start saying no to companies that keep making changes that AREN'T WELCOMED OR WANTED this entire thing is now a joke and I'd rather spend my time elsewhere.

730,2024-07-17 00:00:00,"It's unplayable. The amount of cheaters is crazy. Valve is doing nothing about it and will probably never do anything about it. Only thing they do is put something in the game files about anticheat and dataminers go crazy about it while that is just there to make us think that they are doing something.  The reality is that real anticheat will never come, vacnet will never stop learning and vac will stay useless as it always was. The issue with anti cheat goes back to 2014 and since then vacnet is learning and valve is ""making"" an anticheat.  It's sad that a game with legendary status has such uninterested developers. Half of the game is made up of community made maps, skins and tournaments that are hosted by third parties. Only thing that valve needs to do is make a stable and functional game with an anticheat and they refuse to do that. It's not that they can't make an anticheat they are not an indie studio they are multi billion dollar company that doesn't want to make an anticheat.  We can all stop hopping for an anticheat because it will never be finished. All we are going to get is some lines of text in game files saying something like ""suspicious_hit_odds_threshold, suspicious_hit_payer_radius, suspicious_hit_strategy"". These were found in game files by dataminers in December of 2023 half a year has passed and there is still no sign of an anticheat. And they will just keep putting that useless garbage in game files to quiet down the community when they start asking for a real solution.  The only thing they care about is what brings them profit and anticheat isn't one of those things.","1,163.2",Not Recommended,"44 people found this review helpful

Months and months and I'm still Gold Nova. Damn cheaters and smurfs!   Ok, i just stop rush and spray less, now I'm LEM XD   Bad game. Very bad game. XD   The fact that they added the , a mode that is now , and changing the game in a free to play, make it clear that Counter Strike was and they want to save the salvable.   Since last year, the activity is now double or more. Literally can't play more the game. Happening something like {30 kills, 100% hs} or {45 kills 9 death} or {5 v 1 and still lose} or {when you are winning, also 14-1, enemies in the second half become PRO ESL player} or {you win one or two, then, in the other matches you gain automatically noob rage players} or {more you lose and more the next match will be hard, can't work like that}     Cheaters became smarts, they toggle just when they need (not about the complete match, but about rounds. Example: they toggle when they are in eco and turn off when YOU are in eco. Something like that. Recently our Lord Gaben and developers team push out a new unexpected update: If you run ""weird"" software in background while you play this game, you will be warning. If you ignore the warning and keep doing so, you will go play with people with low ""trust factor"". Can be a good (small) fix. Let's hope! See you again in the 2021. Btw, after 5 years i'm still LEM... damn i'm so noob XD   The Trust Factor update is a complete flop! XD You can search online, everyone say that. Reddit, newspaper about videogames... now the cheaters activity is increased. Literally ANY match you can find one or more of them, in enemy team but also in your team. In this state is totally unplayable. Maybe because of the warning message that dosen't appear in most case, then people think that thier cheats are safe, so they keep use them more frequently. Valve want to stop cheating, but they help them to cheat more... ahaha incredible!    This year is the worse in terms of cheaters, literally any match have spinbots. I remember old times when overwatch cases was so hard to understand if they cheat or not, but now, every overwatch case i see there are 2 o 3 spinbots XD amazing! But hey, finally Valve come to help (a bit) us, the stupid players that still enjoy the game without cheats and they did this:   The best year of my life, because i didn't have played this game for the whole year!   And they come out with Source2... considering i'm curious to see it, i start play again. But: is the same as years ago, toxic community, rage quit, no english, people that have a score of 2-15 in the first half and in the second they becase Pasha with 32-16, no microphone, no headset, no mouse, broken brains, and so on...

Tons of hackers in casual games and official matchmaking on all skill levels, VAC not working at all, people playing with 2$ hacks undetected for years!

730,2017-10-24 00:00:00,"There is no mixed recommendation so i think a positive review would be appropriate here, ill try to sum up the experience in a short.  CS GO is a game about endurance, either you quit it or try playing it in a very hazardous environment. What im trying to say here is that in this game you can find people from all walks of life, hell i can do a social study with all different people ive met so far. The core player base consists of guys in their mid 20's who either act like they know everything (they know s*h*i*t) and mock you most of the games, or guys that swear to you in very different languages e.g Russian, German...  Next are all the kids who had a relationship with my mother that i didn't knew before and they end up spamming in the mic the whole game. The next group are all the people that wasted all their parents money for virtual skins and show off hence ruining the game itself and making a lot of good people leaving the game for good. The next group and probably the one most responsible for ruining the game are the cheaters/hackers who buy hacks every month to ruin other people's experience in the game. Either you have luck to not end up with cheaters most of the daily games or you do, thats a concept of you win some or you lose some. Other group to mention are the smurf accounts, the people with ranks way higher than yours to either make your life easier or harder depending if they end up in your team or not. Those are people that wanted attention but didn't get at the first place so they end up being wiseguys to the rest of us at the lower ranks.  When you get in a competitive match there has to be a person that gets kicked for no reason, another that ends up teamkilling you the hard way, or someone yelling you for playing good and bad. Your self-esteem would be ruined by the end of the match. Though i should mention that the game is more fun and better by playing with friends. But if you are a lone wolf every match is a story in its own, like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Sometimes you will get reasonable people with you sometimes you will hate yourself for playing the game.  The mechanics are okay to me atleast, you still need skill in this game to perform good. Sometimes you will do good K/D/A and lose the match and sometimes you will end up getting zero kills most of the match and win. Making your progress on ranking up nearly impossible.  I can go on about the bad things and the good things about this game which the bad ones outweigh the good ones but ill still recommend the game if you are a particular kind of person who wants to fight his way in a very troublesome community. With the hope that Valve can fix many of the issues that bother this undoubtedly good game.","1,805.4",Recommended,"101 people found this review helpful

730,2017-10-01 00:00:00,"CSGO is a competitive based Team Shooter. Its one of the most popular games on steam,and i dont think I have to explain the gameplay so lets jump straight to the pros and cons.  Pros: -Many Gamemodes some for the more Casual Minded and others for the hardcore players -Many tutorials online to get started as a newcomer -Timeless gameplay that is fun escpecially if you play it with some friends -Big amount of Community Server if the standard game modes arent something you want -Runs on a toaster   Cons -Many People you meet (NOT everybody but most of the time) are pretty toxic -Can get frustrating -Valve Anti Cheat is well...not really working. It can happen from time to time that you get some hackers in Matches. -Smurfs/DeRanker and Griefer will destroy the experience often -Updates that debalance the game -Valve is jut intereseted in selling skins and Cases   As a conclusion if you are a hardcore competitive gamer who doesnt fear a steep learning curve or toxic teammates,and you can ignore the hacker/smurfer/griefer every second game. Then try it out. For everybody else it isnt worth trying. Dont waste your time and money with this game. And try something else! :)  Thank you for reading.

730,2015-08-09 00:00:00,Community is ruining this game. I live in Russia and happen to play on russian servers. This is incredibly awful experience i must say. Russians are the cancer of this game. They are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others. I wish CSGO would cost like 30-50$ on Steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it. I wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn't help because russians are everywhere. It saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting CSGO because of it. I can't enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40-60 minutes. Despite the outcome of the match i still feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they trashtalk 24\7 and rarely able to play. ♥♥♥♥ this game.  PS. I must notice that there is like 5% of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot(not all ) of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others.

730,2013-12-01 00:00:00,"Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter.  The Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source.  I just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  I am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which ""Get rekt"" is the only game mode new players can play.  What surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to ""Classic"" and you're set.  As I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here.  Speaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections.  CS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine.  I haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new ""Competitive"" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure.  The game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast.  I am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too.  All in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Some tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there:  ""In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot.  For starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots.  In 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit.  Don't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot.  Play deathmatch at first to train.  What matters, in order: 1) Aim All weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees.  2) Reflexes You have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first.  3) Map awareness and predictive thinking This is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades.""  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Overall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run.  Maybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide.  Buy it.  Especially if: -it's on sale -you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such -you have good aim -you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature  -------------------------------------------------------------------  ~~~ 9/10 ~~~ A sacred beast of a game.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  ""Counter-Strike is a pretty simple game. All you have to do is click on their heads"" ~ Anonymous",29.5,Recommended,36 people found this review helpful 0

730,2013-08-16 00:00:00,Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the dev’s and the player count keeps increase.  Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points.   **The Good**   * High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS * Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends * Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions * Dev’s connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation.   **Needs Improvment**  * Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). * Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). * Movement and accuracy modifications. * Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) * Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate *   **Overall Rating **  8.5 / 10,"2,574.1",Recommended,21 people found this review helpful 0
730,2018-06-18 00:00:00,"A solid game. Very good shooter mechanics, Very little support from valve. All valve cares about is ""D O T A 2"". Only if valve focused on it's anti-cheat. The community is pretty toxic in CSGO. I still remember getting kicked from the game for being ""noob"" when i was new at the game. And getting cheaters in opponent. This really leaves a bad taste to the mouth of new players and casual players, since they just wanna have a good game. Many people will say ""Go to ESEA or Faceit"" But 60% of the playerbase doesn't even know what they do. So it's not really a solution to cheaters. People like me just wanna get back from school/work and have a fun game or two with friends. Hackers just ruin the game. And the worst thing is, People don't even kick them. They ""wanna"" get boosted by hackers but don't understand that getting boosted will do them nothing good, let alone by a cheater since if the cheater gets banned (they get banned only 50% of the time) they will lose their boosted wins thus deranking. And cheaters, OMG where do I start, VALVE! Please F I X your broken game ! there are literally threads on the CSGO reddit spoonfeeding and showing how to fix certain things. V A L V E still wont fix it. The fact that there is even an hvh community itself puts valve to shame.

730,2022-09-27 00:00:00,"There are huge caveats with a recommendation of this game.  The gameplay when everything comes together is incredible. The feeling of clutching a round for your team, especially when you're with friends, is beaten only by the elation of winning a close-fought match through sheer doggedness and team spirit. Frankly, in those kinds of matches even losing 16-14 can leave you with a smile on your face.  However, I don't know how I would get into this game as a beginner nowadays. Though if I didn't know better I'd probably try the free-to-play version, I recommend at least paying for a Prime-enabled account. The problem with cheaters is very large and could lead to a quick disillusionment with the game. Some veterans even leave the game because of this problem. It's such a terrible sinking feeling when you arrive in a match and see an enemy, or even a teammate, spinbotting or obviously hacking. You just know you've wasted the next 15 minutes or, if they only start hacking after they get angry and falsely believe you're hacking, you've wasted even longer. Either that or you can leave, but you will get a cooldown from matchmaking servers for abandoning a match!  If you are intent on learning it competitively, I'd suggest researching third-party services like faceit (available for anyone as far as I know) or ECL (I believe currently only hosting servers located in Europe). ECL actively moderates its users and seems to have a fairly welcoming community, perhaps it would be relatively easy to find people of a similar skill level willing to help out a beginner. Unfortunately I think the base experience in Valve's own matchmaking system can be horrible and beginners might have a decent experience, or a completely off-putting one with toxic teammates who can't remember what it was like to be new in the game.  Prepare for the worst. I hope you get to enjoy the best of what CS has to offer.","5,731.3",Recommended,"47 people found this review helpful

EDIT: I am sad about the mac support ending, but for now I am playing on crossover and the game is a big improvement from CS:GO in terms of graphics and QOL. If Valve does something to stop cheaters like in Valorant, I will change my review to positive.

730,2024-01-06 00:00:00,"They took CSGO, made the networking worse, made the movement worse, added an anticheat that bans people who spin in circles with high mouse sensitivity, and made the graphics prettier. While people have been getting false banned and then IGNORED by Valve, spinbot cheats just stopped spinning while keeping the bhop and aimlock parts, and they remain fully undetected. So, the game is worse than CSGO in terms of how it feels, better in how it looks, and people are getting false banned left and right and losing thousands of dollars worth of skins with NO help from Valve, while cheats remain extremely prevalent. At the VERY least, their new anticheat was a complete and utter FAILURE.  ""But remember how CSGO launched??? Give it some time, CS2 will get better"" That isn't the point, they gave us a downgraded version of something they spent 10 years working on, which shows that they learned nothing. CSGO had room for growth but it had reached a fairly stable state and was extremely enjoyable and consistent. What we got with CS2 is honestly just depressing.  ""People said the same thing about Source, we can't just play the game game forever. Give it some time, CS2 is a good move for the counter strike franchise"" New is not better by default. CSGO was not necessarily better than Source on launch, but after 10 years of development, there were many additions that added up to make CSGO arguably better than Source. How could CS2 be better than CSGO? Subtick? Dynamic Smokes? Premier?    I don't care about graphics because if you play competitively you make the game look like ♥♥♥♥ anyways. As far as I'm concerned, the graphics are just distracting and cause the game to run worse for people on lower end hardware. In terms of skins, they made glossy skins look way more vibrant and shiny, while matte skins (especially darker matte skins, or skins with dark accents like crimson web) look completely washed out in the light. The lighting is completely overdone in this game, and extremely visible player shadows are a completely new thing to consider while playing.  CSGO was not perfect but if they took the time and energy that they put into CS2 and instead put it into CSGO, they could have made CSGO damn near perfect. Instead we got a game that is going to require a few more years of development until it is comparable to what CSGO was... which is so angering to say because they were already SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CLOSE with CSGO after 10 years of development. Every time I realize that CS2 replaced CSGO, I genuinely become a little bit sad. This game is a massive step backwards from the simplicity and stability of CSGO, and I will not be playing it.","2,746.6",Not Recommended,"44 people found this review helpful

730,2013-08-24 00:00:00,"The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.  I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.  Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.  Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.  Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.",397.9,Recommended,281 people found this review helpful 0

730,2017-06-01 00:00:00,"First of all I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood but not everything is fine and dandy and I will address some of these issues in my review. First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....  Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka:  Screenshot of the comment:  http://imgur.com/a/i80j3  Comment:  'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'  My Response:  1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information  2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.  3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)  4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....  5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).  6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game.

The Pro's : A great way to learn swarwords in multiple languages. I've met alot of very nice people over this game, some even being very close friends till this date. I've learned to play as a team, and that team ecconomy realy does matter.  Cons: Cheaters, cheaters every where.  Back in the day you where like: -""Damn he hit's some nasty shots, he must be good at the game!"" Present: -""Damn he hits some nice shots, he is most likely cheating!""  The Anti-Cheat is a joke and doesn't rly work. You've need to play external third party services to play less against cheaters. Since it went F2P it declined in game value and fun to play.

This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it.  When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners.

730,2021-01-25 00:00:00,"There's no need to present this game, as it's known worldwide. The fact that Valve hasn't put any effort at all into this game in the last decade is also just widely known. Still people buy skins, and the game generates money. Why put effort into something as old as CS:GO? There's only millions of players every month. No need to take care of those.  Valve had a better idea: MAKE IT FREE Valve's Expectation: A lot more players will play the game we ignore so hardly. Reality: Every banned cheater can create another account and continue destroying the gaming experience of others.  If you're really hesitating to get this game or not, I strongly advise against getting it. It feels like every other game is infected by these little cheater parasites. And Valve doesn't care. They announce the 'BIG CHANGE IN VAC-SECURITY', but nothing changed. People are obviously cheating and even bragging about it in the chat. Still no ban.  I don't know when Valve stopped caring about its players, but this is just ridiculous. I know nothing will be coming from my review, but if I can just convince 1 person to not get this game, it wasn't in vain.  Just wait for another few months or years and there will be another Counter Strike. And few days later it will again be infected by cheaters.  @Valve: You're forcefully destroying one of the games, that made you what you are today. Simply by not acting. I always thought you were one of the good big companies, but my opinion is starting to change.  May every cheater's pillow be warm on both sides forever.","2,268.3",Not Recommended,"127 people found this review helpful

I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more.  I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE!

730,2023-09-30 00:00:00,"Why would you erase history of the game (CS:GO) and nuke the entirety of the community hosting fan made custom content in favor of a match making system?  You're in the wrong industry if you think gambling algorithms belong in video games. It was clear the day match makers were implemented, but I think people are finally starting to realize just how detrimental algorithms are compared to the more natural meet and frequent system the server browsers of the old days provided. You won't convince me that adding support for the community after the launch is any sort of appeasement as it's been made clear the priority here is ALGORITHMS.  Generational changes are inevitable, but swapping out systems that were proven to generate the success of the industry in the late 90s-early 2000s is nothing but tom foolery. It isn't a matter of nostalgia, it is the destruction of the very same communities that perpetuate the popularity and strength of the game.  How could a company built by its fan base making mods (some of which turned into full fledged titles) become so unfathomably blinded by trash technology designed purely to increase engagement based on FOMO principles while directly competing with the fans that want to host their own servers?  Forget the ""ground breaking"" engine that has mostly just improved visuals on the surface, the implementation of this was perhaps one of the worst launches Valve has ever pushed out.

I've never seen a sadder excuse for a video game in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ life, here's what Counter-Strike is nowadays  You pay 15 dollars for a great ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, a beautiful game that has built up one of, if not the greatest e-sports scenes around to this DATE, but then you aren't actually allowed to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ play it in its built in multiplayer function because of how many cheaters there are, i've been every rank from GN3-LEM and every other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ player is a cheater, and what makes it worse is they are all closet cheaters, it wouldn't even upset me if they were spinbotting so i could just graciously accept the loss and move on, it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ closet cheaters who make you think you are trash because they are annhilating you but in reality you watch the demo and witness blatant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aimlock, these kids will never be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ banned, at least not in my lifetime, ive literally played with kids who have SCREENSHOTS of their custom clients on their profile who spin bot with ZERO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ penalty.  Valve care so little about every aspect of this game other than revenue it's disgraceful to even list this as a game on the steam store, the lack of thought and care regarding vac is almost impressive, if you want anything close to a decent experience you have to pay for ESEA (Which I do) but that isn't the point, it's the fact that between constant cheaters, bad hit reg on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ models, and terrible 64 tick worthless servers make the game unplayable thats the point, you cant even enjoy one of the best games to ever exist because the lack of care and polish, it's depressing   Every time I open this game I die a little more inside.

730,2019-08-20 00:00:00,"2 things you need to know about this game.  1. Cheaters. lots and lots of cheaters.  2. very flawed report system where basically if you get reported for ""griefing"" a number of times youll get a ban which gets longer each time. Problem being, anyone can report you and there is no proof required. I recently played a game where a guy on my own team was cheating (wall hacking and aim assist, he didnt even have a visible crosshair). I tried to kick him from the game and tell the other team, but everyone on my team was qued with him, so they all reported me and told the other team i was being toxic. So by the end of the game the other team realised i was telling the truth but already reported me, so i came out of that game to a ban.  This can happen a lot if you just get random trolls and toxic players. you get reported and banned just because youre outnumbered.  so those 2 things are currently the biggest problems in the game.","3,428.3",Not Recommended,"135 people found this review helpful

730,2018-11-22 00:00:00,"I've been playing CS:GO for almost a week ;) now and I have to say it's a lot of fun, especially playing a round with school friends in the evening is always fun. Many people like to complain about bad randoms or too many hackers (or smurfs where everyone is a cheater kills one, makes sense) - I can only agree with that to a certain extent. CS:GO is a team game and therefore you need good teamplay / a team, so please queue with a few friends or stop being toxic like a pig and make friends with your random teammates, that's also possible! Since I have most of the time a green trust (drops from time to time on yellow because of too much writing in the chat, apparently Valve does not filter that therefore you are simply muted after X chat abuse reports and downgraded to yellow trust, perfect system Volvo) so I hardly get cheaters and also rarely Smurfs in my game. Finally, I can recommend CS:GO to everyone, if you lose too many games or no longer have fun helps a break - or just play with Premades ;).  Good luck and have fun in the Rankeds, don't freak out too much at the end of the day it's also about having fun!  :)","10,182.7",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 21

730,2017-12-27 00:00:00,"I have been associated with Counter Strike community for 8-9 years now and it has never disappointed me ever. CS:GO has been one of the best game till now I've played of this series. CS 1.6 used to be my favourite but the physics engine of GO is even more impressive. Timely updates and new operations every now and then never ceases to amaze me. Although in the light of recent events, I'm experiencing FPS drops on MacBook Pro 2017 Touch-bar 15inch and a pretty good number of cheaters. Fixing Panorama UI and other issues would sure go a long way.  Here I am, back again after adding 1000hrs more to this game. With the number of cheaters increasing in SEA region on servers specially in high tiers, we need a revamp in the community.  Mandatory update post another 1k hours, it looks like everyone here is waiting for CS-2. Looks like it might just be time to bid goodbye to Global Offensive - The game that got you through toughest times. You'll be missed.","3,638.7",Recommended,18 people found this review helpful 2
730,2019-04-08 00:00:00,"You play for 3000+ hours, have the worst luck, get the worst team mates, watch every single game at the major but still dont get a drop even though your friends get 3, lose all your skins gambling etc, etc, ETC.  Then, you start cheating on a different game; GTA for example. You realize how ridiculously easy it is, and love the feel of aimlock. You think- 'Hmm, why haven't I tried this before?'. So you download free cheats onto a memory stick, boot the cheats up, remove the memory stick and use the cheat on a retake server.  It's instantly so much more fun than you could have ever imagined and you get a bit carried away so you are banned from the server. You realize if you keep doing this you will lose your account very quickly so you say to yourself 'I'll only cheat when they're cheating'. This idea quickly vanishes as you get more and more tilted after every death and realize that you don't actually have to go through this. 'Just toggle on, its literally a click away' a little voice in your head says. So you learn how to cheat subtly and soon you can't actually play well without cheats.  Then one day your friend says he knows someone who makes his own private cheat. He then sends you the .exe over Discord, you stick it on your USB and delete the public cheat. You're now basically invincible.  After a few months of cheating it will slowly lose it's magic so you will get bored and wont care about hiding it anymore. Then one day you will wake up to an overwatch ban.","4,073.7",Recommended,"43 people found this review helpful

730,2016-11-26 00:00:00,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is just a few bug fixes and features away from beating its predecessors. With 100s of hours on this game and previous installments, it is safe to say that CS GO is just as good as providing a competitive and fun experience as 1.6 and source did. One thing I love about the Counter Strike shooter genre at once is the sheer amount of skill required, you cant simply jump into a kill a wreck havoc, you must be able to learn spray patterns, smoke areas, and have a good amount of game sense, in most games the map doesn't make much of a difference towards the gameplay. But Counter Strike: Global Offensive provides a substantial amount of game sense, map knowledge, and gun spray patterns in order to just get the simplest of objective done. The ranks add more gameplay and less repetitive, not only is it fun to say ""IM Master Guardian 2"" but its also a good way to separate different skill groups. Ranging from the Beginning of Silver to all the way to Global Elite.  One incredible feature that is new to Counter Strike is the addition of Workshop. You are able to download maps, gamemodes and also post skin ideas! Awesome way to add value and replay ability to the game! The map balance is a bit screwed up on a few maps, but with a good team you can achieve anything. However not every game is perfect, especially Counter Strike, unfortunately valve really decided to start off with new micro-dlcs. With the recent CSGO Betting scandals. Valves reputation has went lower then it should be. However there is a way to get these micro-dlcs without paying. You can get pretty **** drops when you rank up. The recent addition of spray cans is the worst of the worst. I hate seeing them in my drops as they have no value at all and could have been in the game since the beginning, worst way to charge players.  The verdict is Counter Strike: Global Offensive is just as fun as it was in the past, with new features to give it better replay ability, I think this game shines out to be one of the most played and competitive and fun video games even after 4 years; And that's not easy to say, especially for shooters. The cons can be easily ignored, as they dont provide any substantial benefit in the game, and are just cosmetics. Overall I give CSGO a 8. Its fun and amazing with the exception of Micro-DLC.  Pros:  Upgraded Graphics Fun Competitive Scene New Features Awesome Workshop Content 100% replay ability Lots of Skill Required  Cons: Annoying Micro-DLC's Not very effective anti cheat Slow working developers","2,858.0",Recommended,"25 people found this review helpful

I uninstalled again because the game kept crashing and then not allowing me to reconnect. There are hundreds of people if not more experiencing this for months now but there is very little being dedicated to this game (or the dev team is horribly managed I dunno which). I suspect they are basically in maintenance mode and all dev work goes into content to sell.  Here's a link to other people with the same problem I have:   If your platform constantly requires this degree of user troubleshooting just to play a game you developed in house you need to ask some tough questions.  This game has so much potential but honestly smells similar to the Diablo franchise in 2023: nostalgia marketing with very little effort.,"1,947.2",Not Recommended,"332 people found this review helpful

Харин эсрэг тохиолдолд, 2-3 оростой нэг багт учирна гэж мэд!

Харин цагдаа нарын гол зорилго нь цаг дуусахаас өмнө очиж тэр бөмбөгийг нь салгаад хайрцагнуудыг, бас загаснуудыг аврахад оршино.

Тэгээд чамайг ичих ч үгүй багаасаа хөөхөөр санал хурааж эхлэхийг нь яана! Гэхдээ, арай соёлтой нэг нь чамайг айлын өргөмөл жаал, аль эсвэл торхноос олдсон бутач хүүхэд зэргээр нэрлэх байх л даа. Өө бас муу тоглох ёсгүй шигээ сайн тоглож бас болохгүй шүү. Хэрвээ чамайг сайн тоглоод эхэлбэл эсрэг багийнхан чинь чамайг хууран мэхлэгч, залилагчаар чинь дуудаж эхэлнэ.

730,2022-09-21 00:00:00,"The IWI Negev (also known as the Negev NG-5) is a 5.56×45mm NATO light machine gun developed by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI), formerly Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI).  In 2012, IWI introduced the Negev NG-7 7.62×51mm NATO general-purpose machine gun and is used by the Israel Defense Forces (mainly in the infantry, combat engineer and special forces units). The NG stands for Next Generation. The Negev is a gas-operated selective fire light machine gun that uses propellant gases from the barrel to cycle a short-stroke gas piston operating system under the barrel and a rotary bolt locking mechanism. The bolt itself features 4 radial locking lugs that engage the barrel extension and its rotation is controlled by a pin on the bolt body, which rides inside a camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt contains a spring-powered casing extractor unit, while a lever ejector is housed inside the receiver (it is rotated by the recoiling bolt carrier).  The design was meant to be reliable, especially in adverse conditions. In 1997, it was officially adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).  What this all means is that the Negev NG-7 in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the only true weapon of choice, and if you are caught using anything else you are bald and homosexually homosex.","1,213.8",Recommended,"82 people found this review helpful

730,2019-01-09 00:00:00,"I used to play this game a lot. I really liked it, and at its core I think i still do. They removed some maps, i didnt see why. People say it was to reduce boosting. that day i had a boosting overwatch on mirage. A year went by and they didnt update the map pool like they said, so i started getting pretty into canals. Then they removed canals. In that time they released a trust factor system. A system that automatically turns off if you are queueing for too long. Their anti cheat doesn't work, their map pool is about adding gimmicky maps temporarily, rather than actually changing the core map pool to any relevant degree. In the face of all this, they spend dev time on adding battle royale. They make the game free to play. In free to play people cheat their balls off. New players have a worse experience than ever before. The game has glaring issues and rather than focusing on them, they add new content, and attempt to flood the game with players. It's hard to support this game anymore, makes me sad. Hopefully one day they build an anti cheat that works, but that day is not today. They talk about ai and machine learning and how it's making their anti cheat better. Apparantely its not good enough to stop actual spinbotters though. A toddler could recognize that isnt how any human being could play, but their anti cheat cant. Put the dev time where it counts, this game isnt unfixable. Right now though, youve just turned a whole bunch of people who were tangentially interested in csgo off it for a long time by making it free to play.","2,773.4",Not Recommended,"48 people found this review helpful

730,2014-11-23 00:00:00,"When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like ""immortal"" and ""the definitive multiplayer FPS.""  The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp. The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team. This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages.  Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive. The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2. While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk.  Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol. Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice!  Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for legitimate currency.  CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 500,000 players. There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth. I think its safe to say this is the new ""definitive multiplayer FPS""!  9/10","1,880.0",Recommended,"77 people found this review helpful

730,2024-04-26 00:00:00,"Old fart reporting inn, with a revised review.. as some things just needs to be said..  I have been living and breathing this game since the pre-steam (WONNET) beta-mod for half-life. I've hosted servers, communities, went to majors, even organized LAN's and tournaments myself. At some point our group even got to participate in a dream-hack (cs:go) tournament. (a thing we could never do as organizers).  So it really saddens me to say that it's over with this game.. It's done.. Counter-Strike has become the sewer-pit of this genre..  It looks like valve has lost all control of this title and are unable to keep the game playable. Cheating is rampant on all ranks and in all game-modes. Even in gun-game matches i'm seeing spin-bots going full rage, its horrendous!  Bringing back overwatch will not fix this. Even-though every fiber in my bone as an IT guy is against intrusive apps.. this game needs to step up their AC game and stop messing around with their little pet project deep-learning anti-cheat and go straight to kernel-level.  Our entire group has uninstalled, hoping for a miracle.  This is not Counter-strike any more, this is garbage.","1,937.0",Not Recommended,"51 people found this review helpful

730,2018-11-23 00:00:00,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.","1,171.0",Recommended,21 people found this review helpful 0

730,2017-10-07 00:00:00,"Hi there, I feel like I should write a review for CS:GO as I've spent roughly 5k hours into it.(across 4 different accounts)  I've been Global on multiple accounts, never have cheated. The game used to be fun, but for the past year or so it has just gotten too bad... Cheaters everywhere...I've played on Esea / Faceit as well... it's better but still cancer...(you know what i mean) MM is unplayable, toxic community, griefing and/or annoying teammates 8/10 games ... and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins ...  In the end , i'd recommend not wasting your time with it, out of my personal experience and the countless hours spent in it. CS is dead, most people i know and have played with for years have stopped as well... this isn't just me...  cheers  Edit:1568 hours later. CS2 looks very promising. Skins market is a multibillion $ operation now. Community is still toxic asf in most games and seeing how teamwork is rather necessary it's still a *thumbs down* from me. Game itself is pretty damn good. Still much much better than Valorant.","3,450.1",Not Recommended,"290 people found this review helpful

730,2014-09-24 00:00:00,"First Off... Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken. They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUY skins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free? The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get pissed. And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the ""season pass"". You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it. Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking... EDITED JULY 2019 They have added a TON of stuff. More boxes, some fruity new mode, and tried to 'PUBG' it up. They have made enough money of this game to make HL3 5x over already..","1,658.5",Not Recommended,"107 people found this review helpful

730,2015-04-27 00:00:00,"I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.  The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken.  I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator.

730,2017-10-01 00:00:00,"Counter Strike 2 - Detailed Review  GAMEPLAY -  SUBTICK A quite controversial topic as to say, players expected to see 128 tick servers in Cs2 but valve implemented their new technology, but honestly speaking SUBTICK technology itself is still in beta. As tested by many CS youtubers and game developers it has a weird response time.. In 128 ticks the server responds back 128 ticks in every second and is a constant all across the board but as 'heyzeus' tested its not as simple as that for SUBTICK the lowest tick response was found to be 64 a second whereas the highest was well over 200. So what does it indicate, response time for your shots can actually be very accurate even if you are playing on a high 90 or 100+ ping but it is partially true. The system bring whole lot of bugs and glitches, moat commonly registration fail. Shots fail to register as in competitive or premier I have personally noticed, shots hitting on not where the player/opp. exactly is but instead where he was the server somehow makes a GHOST decision as if where it was and might be in the next second and gives you the user the kill and it displays it as DESYNC. Giving the peeker quite some advantage, if you have mastered the art of A-D Strafing it's likely impossible to get kills against. Quite some fixing to do.  GUN-PLAY ARS - All around the same, but need some revamping on the sprays for AK-47 mainly. SMGS - Same as CSGO, Eco buy get free money win rounds, maybe a big too much run and gun nowadays SNIPERS - If not for the tick system to mess up ur registration, it's hella accurate, even better than csgo. SHOTGUNS - Broken as hell, range needs some nerf and pallet spreads needs nerf.  MAPS & MODES The premier mode is a great addition for hot blood try hard players. Competitive matchmaking is now map based and hopefully they have increased the time it takes for ranks to expire, instead of 30 days should be like 90 days, IMO. Unranked should be brought back for some chill games, for office goers or medical personnel a 9 to 7 or 8 to 4 or people working 12 hr shifts a chill game mode must be introduced for both competitive maps and wingman maps as well. Regarding maps, I expect the return of many maps as the time passes specially for wingman as it's not of current priority now.  CONCLUSION As it stands RN, CS2 is quite a fun game for beginners and veterans alike as long as they don't get queued in together. Many things need fixing but I'll wait the extra year, but I still recommend it, must try and free to play as well.","3,603.3",Recommended,15 people found this review helpful 1

730,2015-01-07 00:00:00,"Update:  Suggestions: - Big Update: Overwatch2.0: => Overwatch Reviewer can send one gotv demo manually to the system once every 24 hours and as long the ban rate of their send-ins is high they can still do it. This would crush cheating => Overwatch sases shouldn't show Skins anymore to make it as objective as possible => There shouldn't be a waiting time anymore between Overwatch cases => Overwatch shouldn't be done with the demo system, but in the main menu with streamed videos. This would remove the loading time, waiting time, it would be easier to skip back and fourth for personal needs to see a situation again etc. => A statement of valve that skipping cases til the end is allowed when you're sure he cheated => In case this data isn't necessary: Remove all 3 major cheating parts and put it together to one: ""Cheating"". This in general is enough and would increase the ban rate by a lot since the investigator doesn't have to review the whole case just to find out if a waller+aimbotter used a bhop script or anti aim for ""external assistance"" and some point.  - Separation of unranked prime and non prime: No prime player currently wants to play unranked because the amount of cheater is too high.  - No overwatch in non prime matches: Most of the current cases in overwatch are fresh made throw away accs playing in non prime. There is no reason to ban them. They will just create a new acc in 2 seconds.  - Removing the rank in dangerzone OR adding overwatch for dangerzone - both will prevent cheating a bit.  - Prime2.0 -> Whoever verifies his profile with a personal ID will get it. Verifying multiple accounts is possible, but all will have the same rank to avoid smurfs. Also if one acc gets banned, all current and future accs with that person ID will get autobanned. The ESL is doing this succesful since 2005 German source:   - Matchmaking Seasons: Every 6 months a new season should start. Player will receive a coin each season with the highest reached rank they've received in that season. Ranks don't reset entirely in a new season, but drop like this: * Any Silver player will drop to Silver 1 * Any Gold Nova player will drop to Gold Nova 1 * Any MG-DMG player will drop to MG1 * Any LE-Global player will drop to LE  - Nerf the deagle base damage so 2 hit kills in the body aren't possible anymore. At the same time decrease the damage dropoff so the damage is the same on mid- to high range.  - Remove the spread of sniper weapons and inaccuracy when just scoping in  - Fix the OBS issue. Valve destroyed usual streaming just because they can't deal with possible cheater.  - Valve should work together with Youtube, Twitch and any other Streamingplatform to manually ban cheater on their Steam- and Social-Account  - Individual buy menu: People should be able to manually set their buy menu for their needs including sets of things they want to buy. Most people for example don't buy a m249 ever. Many buy the same sort of stuff all the time.","5,966.3",Recommended,21 people found this review helpful 31

730,2023-10-14 00:00:00,"no 128 tick servers and sub tick feels terrible. What you see and what ur opponents see seems like its completely different and you end up just getting killed around corners or getting kills that you feel like you shouldn't have gotten. The animations are totally broken when players are strafing with their legs looking like their made of jelly, even after the patch that said it was suppose to be fixed. Regarding sprays sometimes i'm able to mimic the spray-downs I was able to get in csgo and other times I just end up losing track of the spray and where my bullets go. In csgo I'd see where i'm missing and make corrections mid-spray like if i'm too far to the left or something. Not sure if that's a visual thing or just how the sprays are but its just something I noticed. I also don't see the point in making a whole new game but not improving anti-cheat in anyway.

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Furthermore, Valve has proven over the last 10 years that they don't care about their community, if they just continue to buy skins. All bad changes are kept in the game and most wishes of the playerbase are just ignored without any explanation, regardless of the feedback, e.g. removing the bots if someone leaves the game, doing something against the overwhelming toxic behavior of players, etc.. CS2 is a more beautiful version of CSGO with worse anticheat, badly programmed, a horrendous mappool and worse fps and noone even cared about the aesthetics of the game to begin with. Nice job Valve to gain more money with skins by making the game worse in every other aspect.","4,046.9",Not Recommended,"38 people found this review helpful

730,2023-10-24 00:00:00,"CS2 is downgrade from CSGO in nearly every way. Valve promised to release the game this Summer, delayed it until September, and still released it in a gutted, unpolished state.  Danger Zone is gone, the workshop is completely missing, community servers are still not available, and even classic game modes like arms race are nowhere to be found.  CS2 has exclusively pushed competitive 5v5 while ostracizing a large portion of the community that enjoyed CSGO for everything else it had to offer. This would be less egregious if people could still play CSGO, but CS2 has replaced it. Despite Valve marketing CS2 as a ‘sequel,’ it is effectively CSGO 1.5 -reminiscent of Overwatch 2’s release.  Valve’s vision for CS2 is clearly style over substance. The game looks very pretty, however, Counter-Strike has never been about gloss. Unremarkable graphics made CSGO run without a hitch, even on low-end computers. The largest competitive shooter in the world shouldn’t allow for poor frames to hinder someone’s gameplay. Stacking the game full of taxing lighting and shadows doesn’t benefit players in a meaningful way, and insufficient optimization has only exacerbated the issue. Players who have expensive rigs can still expect the occasional frame rate drop or stutter. Many people will not be able to run CS2, and as far as I’m concerned they have been robbed by the deletion of CSGO.  Even though the entire focus has been on ranked play, the competitive integrity of the game in its current state doesn’t hold a candle to CSGO. Valve easily has the resources to provide 128 tick servers but has long ignored the unanimous requests for it, instead choosing to give us a bandaid solution that feels even worse than 64 tick servers did in CSGO. Poor implementation of subtick has caused inconsistent jump height, inaccurate feedback on guns’ spray, and atrocious peeker’s advantage that makes holding angles at high level play almost impossible. What you see is not what you get.  The visual changes to Overpass and the slight rework that Inferno got are both welcome additions, as are the new utility mechanics, but the overwhelming lack of content and inferior gameplay has made CS2 a more than disappointing release.","2,144.6",Not Recommended,38 people found this review helpful 0

Comments: I just really hope the dev team gets the support they need to make this the best game possible.

Each game has its place and if the main concern is skins then that sounds like they should probably not encourage sketchy gambling within their game. Plenty of games thrive without a ""market"".

730,2017-10-13 00:00:00,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.  Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels. The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.  People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.  Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?","3,427.7",Not Recommended,"29 people found this review helpful

730,2016-09-19 00:00:00,"Review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive!  Gameplay:The Game mechanics are in my opinion pretty simple yet extremely effective.Aiming feels almost flawless, no weapons are overpowered if you have enough experience.Game isnt really trying to be realistic. Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps)CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter.  Multiplayer:Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.  The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages. (malaka, cy ka bly at, kur wa, ich fick deine mutter, youre g ay, blo ody bas tard, kardashian) some examples.  Graphics:Game looks ok for a 2004 source engine. Nothing amazing.

730,2023-03-07 00:00:00,"I am a 64 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.  I am a father to my son Tony, who is now 38 years old. My son has always been obsessed with games, as they have given him an avenue of entertainment that he can’t obtain in real life. Recently, Tony downloaded Apex Legends, and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was devastating for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, on account of his disability, which makes him non verbal and not quite mentally there, resulting in him to be under the care of social support workers, who cater to his disability, while I am at work.  In a bid to bond with my son, I decided to make a Steam account, and acquire this game, to see if I could play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial, but unlike games on the Wii, I couldn’t find a couch co op option to play with him through. I asked my son for help, and he was able to host a game for me to join. I loved it, as it was the only real bonding time I’ve spent with my son, since we went hiking, and played games on the Wii years ago. I’ve gotten older since I last went hiking, and don’t have the energy I used to, so to sit down and play with him, in a way he knew how, was like a dream come true.  This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again, and now on the weekends, when I’m free from work, we actually spend time together outside of the house as well. This game reminded me that there’s fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I, many fond memories.",17.3,Recommended,"488 people found this review helpful

730,2015-08-18 00:00:00,"I have a very weird...love-hate relationship with CS:GO. To the point where I really don't know whether to put this game as Recommended or Not Recommended. It really took some deliberation to decide. Because it's honestly both. I both recommend and don't recommend CS:GO.  Let me take you through a very brief history lesson. I started in January 2014. I played up until August 2015 and then stopped. I didn't touch CS:GO for 3 years until June 2018. And since June 2018 - I've been more or less treating it as 1 of my 2 ""main games"". Of course, having learned from my original burnout after clocking 1200 hours - I've taken plenty of breaks from this game, even played on different accounts with lower ranks once playing at DMG/LE stopped being fun. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to why I both love and hate CS:GO at the same time.  Why I love CS:GO: There are a few reasons I love this game. One good place to start would be the satisfying and rewarding gameplay. CS:GO encourages you to practice and get good at a variety of things - weapon control, movement, positioning, strategy, leadership, critical thinking, improvisation - practicing these will lead to huge payouts in your gameplay as it's generally stuff that'll help you get better. Another reason I love CS:GO is, honestly, sentimental value. The entire Counter-Strike series is one that's helped me feel a certain connection that's very close to home for me - family. I was introduced to Counter-Strike through my brother. And as the series progressed and we both got into CS:GO - our bond has grown. I genuinely feel like CS:GO helped me feel closer with my brother and helped us have a mutual understanding of each other - all because of a game series he got me into by playing Counter-Strike 1.3 all those years back! On top of that, CS:GO has made me plenty of friends. Some of which I'm friends with even today - nearly 5-6 years later. From attempting (and failing) to run a CS:GO team to just messing around in Silver games on alt accounts - I've made my fair share of memories with the game. In a lot of ways - CS:GO has just been ""home"" for me.  Of course not everything is sunshine and rainbows. I will get this out of the way right here right now - cheaters. They've always been a problem as far back as I can remember. Always. Fighting cheaters is a constant uphill battle. Valve are trying, but according to the community - they're not trying hard enough. The community is another reason I hate CS:GO. Short and to the point - it's incredibly toxic. And the community just breeds more toxicity. It's really gotten to the point where I really can't tolerate people anymore. And I become toxic myself. My friends who play(ed) CS:GO echo this statement too - some have even had to take extended breaks because trying to be a part of this community has taken a mental toll on them. It's enough to take a look at the General Discussions tab for this game to very clearly see what I mean regarding that.  I could talk about more with CS:GO. The economy, the pro scene, the good part of the community, the flawed Trust Factor system, etc. but I don't want to make this review that long. After all, you're clearly here to see whether you should give this game a go or not. And honestly...I don't think I can answer that. I have my reasons for playing this game all these years later, even if I hate the ever living poo out of it sometimes. But I also love this game and just can't leave it alone.  If you don't plan on partaking in the community and have high tolerance towards cheaters from having experience from other games that have it worse, then...maybe give it a shot? Who knows. It might just be your new ""home"". But if that's not your cup of tea - don't be afraid to just pass on CS:GO either.","2,446.7",Recommended,"16 people found this review helpful

730,2017-01-12 00:00:00,"The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years: 5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.  CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.  There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.  Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.  I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.  [HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team, you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning. [/history]   10 - Perfect game 9 - Excelent game, best of the genre 7 - Average game, nothing really special 6 - Bad game, avoid 5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time 4 - Failed game, unpayable",223.6,Recommended,"33 people found this review helpful

730,2016-06-30 00:00:00,"11/29/23  Game is rampart with cheaters and many team killers, they will shoot on spawn because you do not speak their language for no reason, it is very common, they will persist until they get banned. You cannot do anything about it and Valve just does not care. The only thing certain is that you will loose the game. I can send you as many replays as you want with this.  10/15/23 review update/revised review I gave a try to CS:2 today, I played 5 games. It is by far the worst gaming experience I ever had in my entire life. To begin with I believe when I left CS:GO some weeks ago I had the rank of either DMG or LE. I do not remember. Then I was like let's try the new game, I was very excited. After these 5 games I was left stunned, wondering the state of our race and the prospects of our future. Either the IQ of the general population has dropped or the game attracts creatures that their categorization as ""human"" in some circles could be at best questionable to the extent that it makes you rethink some your values, like your stance against abortion and other sensitive matters that have been solved many years now regarding the humanity as a species.. I need to add for context that I never swear at my teamates, I never insult them, I never shoot them back but in the last game I actually lost my tempter, to the point that things got out of hand, I realized that the last game was no different from the previous ones, I just had enough.  I will explain.  If you enjoy playing with people that choose random maps - THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW - like Vertigo (I do not even know why this map is in the ranked pool anyway), teammates that shoot you, disconnect for no reason, in general scream on the microphone or do not understand the basic fundamentals of the complicated concept of the ""Bomb defusal"" game rules and game style, then yes! You have found your game! Your teamates will rush towards the enemy even if they are CT, they will mostly die in the first 10 seconds and then they will either start cursing at you at you or teamkill you at spawn, flash you or other stuff, what can you do? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You will be forced to spend the next minutes of your life with them, I mean about people that must find the tree that produces the oxygen they spend and to whom they need to apologize for their inexcusable behavior towards other human beings. Valve doesn't give a flying fifu about your fun, or the toxic people you are forced to play with.  It is nearly impossible to comprehend the level of toxicity and darkness that you will endure playing this game and having to live with this Exercise in futility, comparing this to works of Russian authors like Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn and Tolstoy will make you feel you are reading a woke Hollywood comedy.   Old review ---> I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene.   WTF has happened?  This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.  DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE I have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.  Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.  Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.  There is huge but in all this:  Are you willing to pay a subscription? If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.  This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time.","2,089.8",Not Recommended,"313 people found this review helpful

730,2015-02-01 00:00:00,"The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.","9,918.8",Not Recommended,"847 people found this review helpful

730,2016-01-05 00:00:00,"The game is a money pit filled with hackers. The rank system is a joke. Overwatch is a joke. VAC is a joke. There is no anti-cheat system for this game. It has a tired engine. (2004) Source engine It's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)  Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever ! (Not) I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.  They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !  DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen. After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet. Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well. Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow). Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people hence people having so many accounts...  I have 1 account and proud of it.  I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......  By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers. "" I'll just save it"".  If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized. If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....   If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played. If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.   (1/7/15 update) They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!  Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux. You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed.  For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours. I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players. If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do. And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore....... As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!  ""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)   After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.  If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money"" people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played ! This game would be great........ There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.    The Facts and nothing but the facts........!   Oh did i mention the game is a joke !  Changing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's name to ""Hackfest Simulator""","3,329.4",Not Recommended,"689 people found this review helpful

730,2019-01-01 00:00:00,"I'm start by saying that this was a great game for the longest time. super simple fun in comp, causals or in the ""arcade"" type modes. I've spent a many a nights with a couple of cold ones and freinds gathered around the appartment living room just playing on dust 2 for hours and have had a great time doing it. However, this game is the absolute worst when it comes to people using aimbots, wallhacks, etc. It used to be that you'd get one every now and then and you just report him and hope he gets banned and join a new lobby. Since they made the game free getting banned doesnt matter any more. They just start up a new steam account and jump back in.  I mentioned earlier that finding someone who is actually botting would be a rare-ish occurance but tonight I attempted to get some new friends into the game and in the first 3 lobbys (1 casual dustii, 2 arms race) there where botters just one taping everyone from lundicris angles and distances.  I know botting is gonna happen but like dang, calm down. Are you so frustrated that the only thing you can do to release that is to boot up a program and no-skill your way through matches?  So after my friends got killed over and over again but some resentful basement dewller, I suggested we play a round of competitve. ""surely there wont be as many hackers there right?"" Nope. Had some guy boosting his friends with an aim bot. The guy had like a 90% headshot ratio by half time and could hit just about everyone no matter what was going on. His account was permently banned by the end of the match but does it matter? His friends accounts (that were being destroyed by my new-to-game friends) got a comp win due to a series of aimbot aces. The guy who was aimboting has probably already created a new account and is back in comp right now boosting his (proabally) silver 4 friends and now I have 4 friends who dont want to play this game simply because of this experience.  This may seem like a rant, cause it kinda is, but I'm just tired of it. No one wants to play a game with no chance to win. The games community will die down evenutally to where there are only devout cs fans, botters and the passing interested gamer. Making this game free to play was a big mistake that I dont believe can be ratified.

730,2016-04-14 00:00:00,"Since the dawn of time, I have lost hope in fps games and life itself generally because of milked franchises. The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man. CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious. This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).  I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the ""your mom"" 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

The game’s anti-cheat system struggles to keep up, leading to frustrating encounters with aimbots and wallhackers. This undermines the integrity of the competitive scene and drives many players away.  The recent Armory update, meant to breathe new life into the game, falls flat. Instead of delivering meaningful content, it feels like a shallow cash grab with overpriced skins and little to no impactful gameplay changes. The updates increasingly prioritize monetization over player experience, making it harder for dedicated fans to stay invested in a game that’s losing its charm.

Community:  COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the ass.   Competetive:  I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or 2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.   Elo system:  Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global!   Skins:  A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game.   Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?  Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.","2,339.6",Not Recommended,"143 people found this review helpful

730,2015-09-17 00:00:00,"Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:  Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.  Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience.  Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...  BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.  Common idiots. Actually press f1.  I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.  Tryhards. Goes without any words :>  Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.  The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead.  Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.  Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.  Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it.  Thank you for your attention. Now you know what Counter-Strike: Global Offending is.","2,047.4",Not Recommended,"458 people found this review helpful

730,2024-01-17 00:00:00,"Okay so where should we start.... I love the game but there is so many things that should get fixed in order for the game to become 10/10 for everyone and not only for the Counter-Strike lovers. Release of CS2 was really bad they just released the Beta... No new skins, no new operation, no new maps (many maps from CS:GO are not in the game anymore). The game has very bad perfomance issues even on High End systems. It's very easily noticable that in CS2 your spray feels a bit of compared to CS:GO. Let's get over to the worst part about everything and that is that CS2 has a massive cheating problem, I have probably been playing versus over 20 cheaters in my time on CS2 and this is way too much in my opinion. We also have the report system which is completly f*cked. I have gotten griefing banned multiple times without killing a single teammate, not blocking or teamflashes NOTHING. Where is this game going? And as far as I know there hasn't been any cheater that I reported that got banned. So my question to you Valve is, are you happy with the product that you released? In conclusion I do not recommend new players to this game unless the things I listed are getting fixed.

730,2021-01-09 00:00:00,This game suffers from alot of bugs and the optimization does get worse and worse with every patch. (Lower FPS every patch)  The matchmaking servers are filled with cheaters and the servers itself is not good. They have a high variance and a dipping server FPS resulting in a inconsistent experience.  It´s a tiny bit more hardcore than Source was but do not give you that nice feeling Counter-Strike 1.6 and lower did when you was younger.

730,2015-11-21 00:00:00,"CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) is one of the most popular and commercially successful games in the world, released in 2012 by Valve. Despite its popularity, the game has a number of significant drawbacks that can alienate potential players.  Graphics and sound  Although the graphics and sound effects in CS:GO are done at a high level, they are not outstanding compared to other modern games. The character and weapon models are detailed, but the textures of the maps could be of higher quality. The sound effects of weapons and explosions create an atmosphere of tension, but the music in the game leaves much to be desired. It is not memorable and can quickly get boring.  Economy  The skin system in CS:GO evokes mixed feelings. On the one hand, it allows players to earn money by selling skins on the market. On the other hand, this can lead to players spending more time trading skins than the game itself. In addition, some skins can be very expensive, which may displease some players.  Multiplayer  Multiplayer in CS:GO is one of the main advantages of the game, but it also has its drawbacks. The game can be difficult for beginners, and it will take them a long time to master all the subtleties of the game. In addition, the game can be expensive, as players need to buy additional items such as skins and cases. This may scare off some players, especially those who are not willing to spend large amounts of money on the game.  Community  The CS:GO player community can be toxic and aggressive. Players can insult each other, use cheats and bugs, and violate the rules of the game. This may make the game less enjoyable for some players. However, despite this, I am grateful for the friends I have found in this game. We have a great time playing CS:GO together, and that makes the game even more valuable to me.  Conclusion  Despite all its shortcomings, CS:GO remains a popular game that attracts millions of players around the world. However, before you start playing this game, it is worth considering all its pros and cons. If you are willing to spend time learning the game and are not afraid to face the toxicity of the community, then CS:GO can be an exciting and interesting experience for you.

Despite its potential, the game is plagued by hackers.  Hackers Everywhere: You can hardly join a lobby without encountering multiple hackers. They blatantly use wallhacks and aimbots, delivering headshots through smokes as if they weren’t there, ruining the experience for everyone else.  Inadequate Measures by Steam/VALVE: Despite numerous reports, Steam / VALVE seem to take no effective action. The report button feels useless, serving more as a decorative element in the interface ?!  Loss of Game Quality: The fun and challenge that the game once offered are gone. Instead, most of the time is spent being annoyed by obvious cheaters and hoping that VALVE will finally take effective action.  Conclusion: Counter Strike 2 has potential, but the hacker problem is destroying it. VALVE needs to implement effective anti-cheat measures urgently.

730,2013-08-26 00:00:00,"CS2 Year 2 review. Community is full of racist, toxic teammates, griefers, farmers, useless no skill players and blatant cheaters. Most of CS:GO maps and modes are still gone. de_train is back but you need a supercomputer to run it smooth, map layout, wall graffities and other design elements and color palette are worse than CS:GO and even CS:Source version. No destructible objects whatsoever, not even light bulbs. But it's still possible to get some amusement out of it. CS2 Day 1 review. The game that was played and loved by many for many years was treacherously deleted and replaced with pale and clunky imposter. RIP CS:GO 2012-2023. Also, calling this game CS 5 or CS 6 would be more appropriate considering previous major releases. CS:GO review. With matchmaking they made it easy to play the game the way it's supposed to be played - in a competitive 5v5. There's also a lot of casual modes, like deathmatch and battle royale. That had noticeably improved the game. Anti-cheat is doing its job reasonably well. And well-thought microtransactions implementation sealed the success.","5,216.3",Recommended,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

730,2014-01-21 00:00:00,"It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later.  CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back.  It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been.   - Updated maps, visuals & sounds - Emphasis on team play - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers - Extensive customisability & player drops - More realistic player and game behaviour - CS:GO workshop - Pro players - Active development and regular updates - Listens to community - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolution   - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater. - Sound still seems like an afterthought - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks good   Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvement Sound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enough Gameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability Overall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.   I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved.  In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.","1,837.0",Recommended,29 people found this review helpful 0

You're going to get dumb kids who buy $150 knifes with there mums credit card who will call you poor... (from experience) 6. No one in the lower ranks takes the game seriously which can be a big pain for new players wanting to actually play the game properly 7. Only like 10-20 people work on the game. Which is why you get useless/boring updates (operation hydra) 8. Valve only care about the money 9. Valve don't listen to the community who could make the game so much better but instead they put alot more money into dota 2... 10. And finally but almost obvious... Valve's VAC system on csgo is just as terrible as the community.,842.9,Not Recommended,"342 people found this review helpful

730,2022-07-16 00:00:00,Product received for free  准备购买CSGO的同学要注意下面几点！ 1：最好别碰箱子【这种比运气的东西就跟赌博一样，一开根本停不下来，除非你认为你自己是个欧洲人，不然最好别去碰箱子，安安心心的去买皮肤吧！】 2：升级经验是固定的，不管你是多少级，升级都是固定的5000点。每周升级都可以随机获得一个喷漆【有次数限制】或者一把皮肤枪，不过基本都不值钱，每周只能获得一次。40级满级后可以转生，回到1级，同时会送你一个今年的服役勋章，比如你17年满级转生，就送你17年的服役勋章，简单来说这勋章就是拿来好看的。 3：平衡性，不用我说了，皮肤没有任何属性加成，所以不用担心遇到什么人名币战士。 4：CT和T都有自己阵营的特色武器，比如CT的M4A1，T的AK47。【说这个就是想吐槽我有一个萌新朋友抓着我问为什么CT买不了AK47，T买不了M4A1。说实话我可以笑他一年，23333】 5：现在到了2级就能打竞技了，并且定级赛并不是让你定级打10把，而是让你赢10把，赢了10把才算定级完成。每赢2把会冻结你的竞技模式，无法打竞技，这是以你赢的两把的战绩还有之前输的几把比赛帮你测评你的水平，冻结时间结束后才能继续打竞技。定级完成后你才可以随心所欲的打竞技了！ 6：一定要小心一些陌生人，有些心怀不轨的人会加你好友给你发链接，这个时候别去点链接，也别信那些人说的我用XXX元买你刀啊皮肤之类的，这些家伙们都不是什么好人。【提这个是因为在贴吧里不止一次看到有人被骗了。】 7：现在CSGO分两种服务器，国服和国际服，国服目前在18号前没有激活码是没法玩的，激活码自己去百度搜索CSGO完美官网去抢，国服和谐有点严重，血变成石油了，恐怖份子变成了****和谐符号等等。对于国际服玩家，VPN的话我比较建议网易UU和奇游。国际服玩家想转国服的话，跟DOTA2转国服一样，鼠标右键游戏点击属性，在属性页面选择【设置启动选项】，在启动选项中输入—perfectworld steam，确定，然后就可以玩国服了，不过国际服玩家没有激活码也是没办法在18号前进行匹配的。[10.2]这次CSGO更新后，好像打开游戏是让我们自行选择哪个服务器，可以选择国服也可以选择国际服，如果有什么遗漏的欢迎留言补充，这也是我最后一次更新评测了吧。 8:[8.5]最近V社在封中国饰品网机器人，导致中国玩家损失惨重，所以第八条建议，最好是等这次风波过后再用。还是那句话，理性消费才是关键。 最近混了混饰品交易网，饰品交易网主要还是看信誉，不清楚的萌新可以去问问百度贴吧的老哥们，饰品交易网最深的坑就是类似于赌博性质的“抽奖”，这抽奖很容易亏钱，相信有些氪金老哥很清楚的，交易网用来提现或者买枪都可以，但是我不建议去花钱“抽奖”，非常坑，真的非常坑。【7.30】因为某饰品交易网的事情搞得很多人被坑，因为我早就不玩饰品了，就不予评价，不过不是这次事件，某网的黑点也够多的，比如以前被串号转库存这些事情不少有，不过这次更新不说这个，这次我想教下萌新们安全地卖皮肤：去百度贴吧，饰品交易吧把你想要卖的饰品信息挂到贴吧里，跟别人谈价，等确定买家之后走饰品网，挂好饰品后把信息告诉买家，让他买。注意一点，这个是最重点的，无论什么情况，所有交易必须都是走饰品交易网，若他非要不用交易网和你进行交易的话，请不要跟他浪费时间，这种饰品交易不走交易网还会去市场？这种人不走交易网就是想坑走你的饰品，那种“买家”会要你去其他什么狗P网站交易，然后再申诉把钱拿回来，走饰品交易网至少不会被骗，目前由于某网出了这么大的事情，肯定有萌新在思考用什么交易网，因为我出了饰品坑所以也不好说哪些，但是我们有万能的百度贴吧老哥们，萌新可以去问CSGO吧的兄弟们什么交易网可靠，记得没错的话，好像置顶帖就有教的，然后饰品交易过程，最好是越短越好，所以要先找到买家再去挂饰品交易网，十几块的皮肤不需要用我这个，但是几百块以上的最好要先找到买家，再直接挂交易网，这次某网事件我就不说什么了，最后给各位萌新留一个提醒：饰品是个大坑，切勿沉迷饰品，别因为一时冲动，吃半月尘土。 9：国服出了后，为了少点萌新被骗，我给第6条补充一下，先说说目前骗子骗人的骗法吧，基本上想买你的刀或者找你打联赛的，全都是骗子。有人以前好奇，说为什么不能点链接，我就给你们讲讲吧，这是库存链接，对于绑了手机安全令牌的还好，没绑的绝对会出事，它会把你所有库存交易给对方，手机还好可以确认是否交易，但是没绑手机令牌的同学就惨了。然后别以为有手机安全令牌就可以随便浪了，有些黑客早已经弄了个盗号网站，等着你浪呢。目前骗子最喜欢用的手法是打联赛缺人来骗你，因为是机器人自动发话，我就给你们讲讲骗子一般怎么骗人的吧。 骗子：我们联赛缺一个人，你打什么位置？ 萌新：？？？ 骗子：行，我知道了，你加下我们领队，她会告诉你更多。XXXX【这是库存交易链接】 这时候，只需要删除好友即可，别想着去调戏，这是电脑人不会回复你的。 ------------分割线------------ 可惜了2018年12月之前的号都有忠诚徽章，优先免费。,"1,043.4",Recommended,"115 people found this review helpful

730,2024-01-11 00:00:00,"Trust me, I would love to recommend every person I know to play this game. I love it to death. I wouldn't be the same person I am today without this game. Unfortunately when CS2 replaced CS:GO, they pretty much replaced CS:GO but made everything worse. Cheating is somehow worse, sub-tick sounds fantastic on paper but ruins the feel of everything, the movement is horrible, the gunplay feels significantly less refined, 90% of the games content was just outright removed, the game did not launch with community servers, there have been multiple false ban waves, and much more. Also, now people with low-end PCs can just not run the game at all. I would only recommend adding this to your library to install the CS:GO legacy beta branch and find an IP to a 5v5 server or something. I hope one day Valve listens to all the complaints so I can change this review, but right now this game is a disappointment.","2,869.1",Not Recommended,24 people found this review helpful 10
730,2021-06-19 00:00:00,"After putting a decent amount of time into this game I have come to find that is all in all an enjoyable game to play(especially so with friends). As far as playing games go I have always liked playing competitive fps' as I find they are fun to learn and it is satisfying to do well as much as it is fun to win in ranked. The skill threshold for this game is sufficiently high while you can still play it casually and enjoy it if you don't mind getting destroyed by the occasional smurf every now and then. if you want to improve however this is the easiest way to do so.  -Learn recoils for different weapons.(workshop maps are amazing for this) -Learn nades( pop flashes, smoke and molly lineups etc) -Up to preference but as I'm still learning all the maps I stick to one or two maps when I play before switching to another once I'm confident on that map and can remember smokes and where to play. -Watch pro league watching better people play can help you learn how to play. -Youtube videos on how to play are good but I mainly just recommend watching them for nade lineups and good positions to play. -As good as trying to play like a pro like stewie2k sounds just make sure to remember what works for pros might not necessarily work for you as you probably don't have the game knowledge or aim that they have i.e. as cool as being like the smoke criminal may sound rushing through t smoke when you're ct probably isn't the greatest idea.(unless you have REALLY good aim in which case who knows it might work out for you.)

730,2024-08-16 00:00:00,"Despite Counter Strike having a prestigious & storied history as a competitive multiplayer game, the current crowd & community + difficulty level means that the game is not entirely welcoming to Players who aren't optimised towards taking a pre-aimed headshot kills mostly 95% of the time. This can lead to a very frustrating experience. This is made worse with lack of map knowledge, requiring a lot of trial & error (without guidance) till you successfully figure out higher success rate pixel peeks, and seemingly repeat the same scenario again & again.  It's nice to play with friends, but the unforgiving nature of the game, means you're probably better playing Deathmatch mode than even Casual mode.

730,2015-04-07 00:00:00,"Dear Counter-Strike Players, After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last!   First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive!   BUT: There are some things Valve has to change really fast!   1. Cheating: There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!  2. DDOS-ing: I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!  3. Smurfing: Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!  4. Patches: Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!  5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver): Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!  6. Community: The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.   Over all: Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!

730,2017-01-21 00:00:00,"It's legit one of the worst games of all time. (I rate it 1/10, even that's too high) Let me explain why:  - The anti-cheat system There is no need to explain how bad it is. It's so bad, that people are getting banned instantly for using skinchanger, but a friend of mine got OVERWATCH banned (not even vac) 7 (!) months after he started cheating. Good job valve. Oh btw, it was a public hack, he didn't even pay a single cent for it.  - The community It's cancer overall. Seriously, so many people in the community are either toxic, can't speak English, or are just trolling around and thinking that's fun. I lost so many ranks and matches just because some c*nts don't speak any language or don't even speak at all (yes, there are people who don't even talk to you). If you kill someone in a cheeky way, you are called a cheater instantly.  - The matchmaking system Let me explain it: You are playing with 4 other people (which can be your mates aswell if you queue with them) against 5 opponents. Basically, it's meant to be competitive. But in some cases the matches are so one-sided, that it makes you rage so hard that your neighbours call the police at 2 a.m. Ranking up takes up to 17 wins in a row (I had to win 17 games in a row to rank up to global), but you can rank down 3 ranks after a lose (happened to a mate of mine). It's absolute bullsh*t, and don't even bother trying to play.  - The servers 64 tick, extreme lags, hitreg and server delay are enough cancer. But there are some bugs which are so weird and wtf that it's ?? For example, there used to be a glitch that if you spammed a buy bind, that you spawned as a spectator. IN MATCHMAKING FFS. If there are such glitches and volvo still doesn't care and add sh*tty gloves, you know that it's over.  - Valve itself As mentioned earlier, they don't give a sh*t about anything the community says. They used to care about the community back then in 2013, when skins weren't even added yet. In 2014, they added the CZ-75. It was legit better than rifles. For 300 dollars... A pistol... It took them 8 months to nerf it, until it was nerfed to hard that it was rekt completely. In 2015, they added the revolvo. It was a pocket awp. It had the same stats as the awp, before it was nerfed 2 days later. After this, it was clear that valve doesn't give a sh*t about anyone. They kept adding stuff like graffitis, gloves, new skins... In 2017, they still don't care about anything. They ""UPDATED"" the negev. Great update.  In conclusion, please don't play it. It's not worth your time.","2,067.9",Not Recommended,"28 people found this review helpful

Essentially every time you get a kill you upgrade to a new weapon which is a lot of fun. + Nice selection of guns + Great Sound Effects  ~ A bit too competitive.

Some might love this, others may hate this aspect.  - You die extremely fast in this game, and can not regain health. - Very repetitive. There isn't many game modes, and you mainly end up playing Bomb Defusal (which is basically Search & Destroy if you are more familiar with Call of Duty) - Microtransactions ""Skins"" which are very costly - I feel like Counter Strike lacks features that other shooters have. ADS (Aiming Down Site), Vehicles, Gametypes, Killstreaks, Leveling / Progression / Unlock systems, destructable environments, going prone, sliding, leaning, etc. - In competitive play, a large portion of time is spent watching others play.

730,2015-12-01 00:00:00,"Well hi and thanks for stopping by.  After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO. If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull. What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters. But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible. Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.  When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.  I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.  Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank. Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet. But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch. Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.  Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say 10/10 Looking forward to playing more.","1,279.8",Recommended,"14 people found this review helpful

730,2019-04-27 00:00:00,"This will be my first review ever on Steam, it's sad it has to come under these circumstances but after 2.5k+ hours on csgo I feel sick to my stomach and I want to let people know what's up.  CSGO is dead, the devs are letting cheaters (mostly Russians) plague servers without batting an eyelash. VAC (the ""anti-cheat"" system) is useless, as is the overwatch. With the game turning f2p hords of hopelessly bad players came flooding servers, turning hacks on the second they get killed by legit players. I've been in games where all 9 other players were openly cheating, activating spinbots, speedhacks, wallhacks, no recoil and many others.  I haven't had a single cheater-free game in days. It's shameful for Valve to allow an otherwise great game to get dragged in the mud so pathetically. This is not just a huge waste for the industry, it is also a blatant message that Valve does not care about their community. To me it is disgusting that they would let down a 20-year loyal playerbase in such a disgraceful manner.  Sad times   Edit: With Valorant coming out, one really realizes how CSGO actually is hot garbage lol. Servs are trash, the netcode is basically a diceroll meaning your aim doesn't count because the game is developped so poorly. Glad it is getting rekt by Val, Valve deserves Riot as a competitor, both companies are a pile of impotent fools who are clueless af.

730,2023-12-23 00:00:00,"To be honest, CS2's performance is completely below expectations. After such a long polishing process, the outcome is quite disappointing. Ignoring the existing bugs, which I assume will be fixed in future updates, the main issues for me are the strange feel of the weapons and odd feedback on headshots, giving a waxy sensation. The game's visuals, perhaps due to my unfamiliarity, seem tiring, with overly bright brightness. Despite expecting to adapt quickly to lower graphics settings as in CS:GO, it's evident that the experience lacks the satisfying feeling of the GO era. Lastly, it feels like CS2 is leaning towards CF, and while some added features like throwable monitoring aren't necessarily bad, they seem unnecessary, adding an extra layer that might be considered superfluous. Ultimately, having spent my entire university period with this game, I hope CS2 can carry the legacy and I trust Valve to refine it. We've seen the significant improvements brought by Source 2, and I believe CS2 has substantial untapped potential.",725.9,Not Recommended,34 people found this review helpful 2
730,2021-09-04 00:00:00,"Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.  I will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.  There are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.  In saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.  If you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.  This game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.  Now i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:  The Negatives: 1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming. 2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo. 3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.  The Positives: 1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that. 2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team. 3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game. 4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.  Thats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for. Hope you all have a lovely day and keep on fragging!",724.2,Recommended,"29 people found this review helpful

It is an extension of the already legendary iterations such as Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source.  Whilst there are a lot of issues with the game - always has been - e.g cheaters especially, the game is rising in popularity still to this day after almost 10 years, which speaks for itself really.

730,2016-04-17 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive  The game itself is very enjoyable, especially when playing with friends. Unfortunately, the community greatly ruins the game. Since it transitioned to a Free-to-Play model, a large portion of people behave without consequences; insults and griefing are commonplace. On the other hand, there's Valve, which tries to extract as much money from the game as possible. However, a significant plus of this game was/is its e-sports scene, which, right after League of Legends, has no equal. I recommend it if you play only with a group of friends. If you play alone, the ranked mode can cause anxiety and make you lose interest in the game.   I thought it couldn't get any worse, and I was somewhat wrong. Broken optimization, anticheat doesn't work, half of the original content has been removed, the game lacks anything to entice a player to dedicate their time to it.","1,911.4",Not Recommended,"74 people found this review helpful

730,2016-12-27 00:00:00,"I think I've played this game enough to write a review about it now.  Pros: + Great game to play with friends. + Balanced by competitive ranks. + Thousands of community server to play on. + Can make money from skins and operations. + Fun to watch eSports.  - Not well optimized, CPU intensive game. - - New players will encounter cheaters as they will be non-prime when starting CSGO. - Toxic community (make sure you have friends to play with in MM). - Really bad anti-cheat. CS:GO has 10,000+ hacks available which are undetected.  EDIT: CS:GO is now free so basically if you have a non-prime account you'll most likely encounter cheaters. But I have a decent trust factor now and I hardly face any cheaters, hence I changed my review from negative to positive. FACEIT is also fun as they have a great anti-cheat.","4,778.1",Recommended,"No one has rated this review as helpful yet

Always there is a cheater in the game.  + Plenty of well designed maps + Visually very appealing + Very high player population with great matchmaking that will get you in a game in less than a minute at any time of the day. + The Arms Race or ""Gun Game"" mode is a favorite of mine. Essentially every time you get a kill you upgrade to a new weapon which is a lot of fun. + Nice selection of guns + Great Sound Effects  ~ A bit too competitive. People take this game extremely seriously and spend hundreds if not thousands of hours memorizing the map and perfecting their aim. Some might love this, others may hate this aspect.  - You die extremely fast in this game, and can not regain health. - Very repetitive. There isn't many game modes, and you mainly end up playing Bomb Defusal (which is basically Search & Destroy if you are more familiar with Call of Duty) - Microtransactions ""Skins"" which are very costly - I feel like Counter Strike lacks features that other shooters have. ADS (Aiming Down Site), Vehicles, Gametypes, Killstreaks, Leveling / Progression / Unlock systems, destructable environments, going prone, sliding, leaning, etc. - In competitive play, a large portion of time is spent watching others play.

730,2015-06-21 00:00:00,"So, after 1000 Hours of this game, I know pretty much all I need to know for a review. This game is amazing and all, but there are a couple flaws. I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank.  If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned.  I give it a 8/10.","3,088.1",Recommended,"13 people found this review helpful

730,2018-12-18 00:00:00,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive maintains much of what made the original Counter-Strike (and Counter-Strike: Source) so fantastic, while adding a couple of new game modes, both of which were based on user-made mods to the original game.  Counter-Strike continues to enjoy the enthralling gameplay and near-perfect balancing that took it from a cult hit in college dorm rooms to one of the seminal games in the multiplayer first-person shooter genre.   In case you're unfamiliar, Counter-Strike is an entirely multiplayer experience. You can play offline against AI bots, but these are still merely simulating what it's like to play online, rather than really giving you a single-player game.  The good news is that this is as good as online team-based shooters get. In the traditional game mode, there are two types of matches and two tiers of play. Casual level is for newer players and removes aspects like friendly fire and the need to purchase armor and ancillary items each round (more on that in a second). Ranked level is the original style of CS, with all the ""realism"" settings enabled, but it also features a comprehensive skill-based ranking system to try to balance teams and place good players with other good players.  CS:GO adds plenty, tweaks a little, and keeps the best parts of the classic multiplayer FPS. If you're into shooters, team-based gameplay, or just classic games that are updated well, you won't do better at the moment than CS:GO.","48,806.2",Recommended,"18 people found this review helpful

730,2017-12-10 00:00:00,"The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place.  You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.  Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!  And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single ♥♥♥♥ about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts!  This game is a broken pile of neglected ♥♥♥♥ with no redeeming qualities, barring an unintended engine exploit dating back to 1996, that the current devs have tried their best to kill anyways.  Do not buy this game if you value your time, your mental health, your money, or your morality.","1,943.9",Not Recommended,"69 people found this review helpful

730,2023-09-28 00:00:00,"Once again I find myself wishing that Steam had a ""neutral"" option for reviews. CS 2 is far from a bad game (in many ways it's a very noticeable step up from CS:GO) but for me in particular, it's a net negative coming from the game it replaced. I spent over 1000 hours almost exclusively playing the Arms Race game mode (gun game in other games) since I don't particularly enjoy the base modes, but like Counter-Strike's gunplay.  When CS 2 was announced I expected that it would launch with Arms Race and didn't really think much about the fact that it was going to be yet another game that completely replaces its predecessor, essentially deleting it from people's libraries. Then CS 2 actually came out yesterday, I loaded it up... and Arms Race was nowhere to be found, alongside my CS:GO achievements. Now, I can perfectly understand wiping the achievements (although it still stings a bit) but removing Arms Race is a bit too far. What's the point in taking away the game I had (which worked perfectly fine, by the way) and replacing it with something that doesn't have everything I had before in it? Why not just make a new entry in my library and let me play the old game? I would even understand limiting CS:GO to community-run servers if Valve doesn't want to dedicate considerable amounts of resources to the ""old"" game.  This is the same crap Blizzard pulled with Overwatch, and it irks me to no end. CS:S didn't ""overwrite"" 1.6. CS:GO didn't ""overwrite"" CS:S.

Having a game put out that allows people to kill you without you being able to see them due to sub-tick is just poor planning. Sub-tick does not replace 128 tick servers. It might be more accurate when it comes to who actually shot first, but it feels horrible on the user's end.
